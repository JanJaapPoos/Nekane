abstract = {Nets with a small mesh size are required to catch Nephrops norvegicus, consequently large quantities of small whitefish are also caught, and much of this bycatch is undersized and is discarded dead. The main bycatch species are whiting (Merlangius merlangus), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and cod (Gadus morhua). Here we summarize the known behavioural reactions of these species towards conventional trawls and review the results of using different trawl modifications to increase selectivity of Nephrops trawls. The trawl modifications are categorised as separator grids, separator and guiding panels, square-mesh panels, capture avoidance designs and codend modification. Finally, the extent to which these developments have been legislated for is discussed including the conditions under which new gear regulations have been introduced. Haddock and whiting rise during the trawling process facilitating their separation from Nephrops and escape, however the behaviour of small fish of these species is less consistent. Cod and Nephrops remain on bottom of the trawl, so to separate these species requires some physical filtering process. Overall, there is currently sufficient technical ability to improve selectivity in Nephrops trawls. The design of choice is dependent on the objectives of managers; for reducing discards but retaining marketable fish, square-mesh panels offer the most useful tool; to eliminate all bycatch and create a single-species fishery, grids and traditional Nephrops trawls show most potential. Whatever the objectives of the new measures, it is likely that a short-term economic impact will follow, and some form of incentive may be required to implement effective measures. A voluntary uptake of new measures by industry is preferable, however, to date, restrictions on fishing opportunities have been necessary to introduce innovative gear designs.},

abstract = {Discarding is considered by many as an important problem in world fisheries. In many regions, data collection onboard commercial vessels has intensified, and the understanding of both human and ecological drivers of discards is improving quickly. Discarding patterns vary widely across regions, fisheries, gears, and species. Fishers' responses to regulations and markets explain these complex patterns, on top of resource availability partly driven by environmental fluctuations. This expanded knowledge base provides an appropriate basis for discussing the discard mitigation measures proposed in various settings. In September 2012, a theme session was convened at the ICES Annual Science Conference in Bergen, Norway, to discuss these issues. This themed set of articles includes several of the studies presented at the theme session. Owing to the wide diversity of drivers and reasons for discarding, no single management measure or even framework is expected to address the issue. Rather, discard mitigation measures need to be tailored to each particular fishery, or even species within a fishery, and the effectiveness of solutions is greatest when they are used in combination with other approaches. Bottom-up approaches to bycatch and discard management, which involve incentive-based solutions to bycatch problems, were agreed to be the most promising. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {In multispecies fish communities, predation levels change dynamically in response to changes in the abundance of predator and prey species, as influenced by the fisheries that exploit them. In addition to community-level metrics, it remains necessary to track the abundance of each species relative to its biological reference point. In situations with many interacting species, exploited by multiple fishing fleets, it can be complicated to illustrate how the effort of each fleet will affect the abundance of each species. We have adapted the AMOEBA approach to graph the reference levels of multiple interacting species exploited by multiple fleets. This method is illustrated with 10 species and eight fishing fleets in the North Sea. We fit a relatively simple response-surface model to the predictions of a fully age-structured multispecies model. The response-surface model links the AMOEBA for fishing effort to separate AMOEBAs for spawning stock biomass, fishing mortality, and yield. Ordination is used to give the shape of the AMOEBAs functional meaning by relating fish species to the fleets that catch them. The aim is to present the results of dynamic multispecies models in a format that can be readily understood by decision makers. Interactive versions of the AMOEBAs can be used to identify desirable combinations of effort levels and to test the compatibility of the set of single-species biological reference points. ?? 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {This paper discusses some formal techniques for deciding how harvesting policies should be modified in the face of uncertainty. Parameter estimation and dynamic optimization methods are combined for the Ricker stock-recruitment model to show how exploitation rates should be manipulated to give more information about the model parameters; in general, harvesting rates should be lower than would be predicted by the best fitting recruitment curve unless this curve predicts that the stock is very productive. A decision procedure is developed for comparing alternative stock-recruitment models; when applied to the Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), the procedure indicates that an experimental increase in escapements would be quite worthwhile. It appears that there is considerable promise for extending these methods and procedures to cases where the stock size is unknown and where fishing effort is poorly controlled.},

abstract = {A system of n competing logistical species of the Volterra type under proportional harvesting strategy is analyzed. In case of selective harvesting, when the effort is adjusted to each species, the optimum effort may result in the total maximum sustainable yield (TMSY 1). When it exists, reaching TMSY 1 does not affect the system stability character, but it does affect the state, and hence some populations may reach too small a value to persist in nature. If competition is strong, species with smaller biotic potential may be driven to extinction. In case the system is harvested with a common harvesting effort, such as in trawler fishery, the total maximum sustainable yield (TMSY 2) is smaller than TMSY 1, and all the species with lower or equal biotic potential to the optimum harvesting effort will be driven to extinction. In this case a call for implementation of the MSY is equivalent to a call for the extermination of some species and it runs directly against the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 1992). Therefore, all legal documents advocating MSY in ecosystems starting with the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPI, 2002) must be urgently retracted and replaced with adaptive management which will respect CBD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is, theoretically, the largest yield that can be taken from a single species' stock over an indefinite period. Formulation of strategic MSY management goals is, however, complicated by the need to move beyond biological single-species considera- tions. Interactions among species necessitate multi- species (MMSY) definitions, incorporating ecological, economic and social considerations. We developed an ecological− economic model of the Baltic Sea, simulating stock dynamics of interacting popula- tions of cod Gadus morhua, herring Clupea haren- gus and sprat Sprattus sprattus. We investigated a set of different strategic management options. These likely, yet non-formalized experiments eval- uate and illuminate alternative regional trade-offs. We computed multi-species maximum economic yield (MMEY) under certain eco logical constraints, with profits as a performance indicator. An uncon- strained profit-maximizing management strategy would lead to a highly profitable cod fishery in a cod-dominated ecosystem. Concurrent sprat stock size (and profits) would be low, falling below eco- logical precautionary reference points. Considera- tion of ecological constraints on minimum stock sizes leaves a range of strategies, including the change from a cod-dominated to a more clupeid- dominated system. The regional distribution of prof- its depends on the management. Therefore, adjust- ment payments or other forms of compensation might be needed to achieve a concordant agreement on strategic multi-species management goals.},

abstract = {Demands for management advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, further complicated by corresponding requests for advice on the environmental impacts of alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment.},

abstract = {A Dutch pilot study of fully documented fisheries provided the opportunity to observe actual changes in fishing behaviour under catch quota management (CQM). Interviews with fishers in the pilot study aided in interpreting the results and giving insight in the decision making process and reasoning of fishers. The CQM pilot study entailed a fleet of small and large demersal vessels. For these vessels, all cod catches were counted against quota, including catches of individuals below minimum landings size. To obtain reliable catch data all vessels were equipped with electronic monitoring (EM) systems. These systems recorded videos of all fishing and processing activities on board. In return, fishers received a 30{\%} quota bonus for cod and were compensated with more flexibility on effort regulations. It was hypothesized that vessels in the CQM will (i) increase their landings by 30{\%} according to their quota bonus, (ii) increase the use of gear with large mesh size, and (iii) change effort towards fishing locations with high catch rates of large cod and avoid areas with high catch rates of undersized cod. The results showed that CQM had no effect on fishing behaviour of the small vessels. In contrast, large vessels significantly increased their cod landings (216{\%}) and avoided undersized cod. This difference in response of different fleets suggested that implementation of CQM, for instance in the context of the European Common Fisheries Policy, should consider fleet characteristics. It seemed that larger vessels in this study more easily adapted their behaviour to new management regimes and that the quota bonus opened up new fishing strategies, that were not envisaged during the implementation.},

abstract = {The new Common Fisheries Policy aims to reduce the discard rate in Europe, and one way in which it seeks to achieve this goal is by making it compulsory to land all species subject to catch limits, and some of species managed by minimum catch size. The characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea raise serious concerns over the viability, efficacy and consequences of these measures, and the purpose of this study is therefore to analyse these with a view to improving discard management in this region. The Port of Santa Pola was chosen as a reference fishing port in the Spanish Mediterranean for quantitative analysis, comparing all the species caught with those proposed by the CFP. Additionally, a qualitative SWOT analysis was performed, incorporating the views of fishermen, administrators, NGOs, scientists and entrepreneurs on the regulation. The daily discard rate during the period analysed was 11.7t (All Species) and 1.8t (Regulated Species), with annual discards totalling 2623t (47.3{\%}) (All Species) and 421t (7.6{\%}) (Regulated Species). The regulation was found to have more weaknesses and threats (72.6{\%}) than strengths and opportunities (27.4{\%}). The governing system should take into consideration the contextualisation of discard management according to the specific characteristics of each m{\'{e}}tier; coordination between stakeholders; and caution about the ecological cost of landing discards. The high logistical, surveillance, monitoring and ecological costs produce a negative outcome despite the objective pursued, the willingness of the fishing industry to reduce discards and the profitable use of the resource by its proposed end users. This may lead to the measure proving unviable in the Mediterranean Sea and its ensuing failure to reduce discards. The alternatives proposed in this paper may help to improve the management of discards and create more sustainable and profitable fisheries.},

abstract = {Spatial management measures are currently being used to manage bycatch and discards, given the spatial heterogeneity of fish distributions. However, permanent fishing closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics and do not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial manage- ment tools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a coman- agement or self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US. Real-time catch and discard information is shared among fishers to incentivise and encourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differ- ences, in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatial management systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework is developed to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and reg- ulatory real-time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practices in the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spa- tial management tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial management approaches can create incentives for fishers to develop, use and share information and technology to avoid undesired catch. Compared with Europe, the US has devel- oped spatial management tools with more truly real-time mechanisms and with greater involvement of the fishing industry in designing and operating the tools.

We contrast eleven types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields (MSY) from mul- tiple stocks and compare their effectiveness based on the results of management strategy evaluations (MSE) that use complex food webs in their operating models. Plans that primarily target specific stock sizes (BMSY) consistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing pressures (FMSY). A new type of self- optimising control rule, introduced here to conquer uncertainty due to structural instability, led to intermediate yields. Plans to “maximise the yield from each stock separately” in the sense of a Nash equilibrium produced total yields comparable to yields from plans to maximise total harvested biomass, but tended to be more robust to structural instability. Most types of plans outperformed single-species management plans that set pressure targets without explicitly considering ecolog- ical interactions. Our analyses highlight trade-offs between yields, amiability to fair negotiations, and continuity with current approaches in the European context. Based on these results, we recommend directions for future developments of EU fisheries policy.},

Consequently, the challenge for those tasked with providing management advice for Australian fisheries has been reconciling the need to achieve specific risk-related sustainability objectives with the reality of the available data and assessments for data-poor species and fisheries. Some general recommendations regarding how to achieve this balance are drawn using case studies from two multispecies trawl fisheries. The lack of data on which to base quantitative stock assessments using population dynamics models does not preclude the development of objective harvest control rules. Evaluation of harvest control rules using technical procedures (e.g., the management strategy evaluation approach) is ideal, but implementation before rigorous testing is sometimes a necessary reality. Information from data-rich species and fisheries can be used to inform ‘‘assessments'' for data-poor species and thereby develop appropriate control rules. This can be done through formal methods, such as the ‘‘Robin Hood'' approach (in which assessments from data-rich species are used to inform assessments of data-poor species), or less formally by grouping species into ‘‘baskets'' and basing management decisions on one appropriate member of the group. Stakeholder knowledge and buy-in to the process of developing appropriate harvest strategies are essential when species or fisheries are data poor. Use of this information, however, needs to be constrained by policy decisions, such as prespecified performance standards. There will always be a trade-off between the cost of data collection and the value of a fishery; in this article, we highlight that this trade-off does not have to be a major impediment to the development of realistic and sufficiently precautionary control rules for the management of data-poor species and fisheries.},

The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential social and economic impacts of the discard ban in European small-scale fisheries (SSF) and the critical factors for its successful implementation. An exhaustive systematic literature review and a stakeholder consultation were carried out in order to (i) collect detailed information about current knowledge on discards in EU SSF and gauge stakeholder perceptions about potential impacts of the discard ban in European SSF, (ii) examine the capacity of the SSF industry to implement the discard ban, and (iii) explore the limits and feasibility of implementing such a measure. The results of this study show that little attention has been given by the scientific community to discards in EU SSF. Indeed, the systematic literature review shows that this problem is relatively unexplored in the EU. In addition, the effectiveness of a discard ban in industrial fisheries is still unclear, mainly because discard data are not systematically collected by fisheries authorities. Stakeholders mostly perceive that the new landing obligation was developed with industrial fisheries in mind and that compliance with the landing obligation in EU SSF will be difficult to achieve without high economic costs, such as those related to the handling and storage of unwanted fish on board.},

abstract = {Harvest strategy approaches based around empirical indicators and/or control rules are beginning to be accepted in a growing range of data- and capacity-poor fisheries. While there is an increasing body of work around developing empirical indicators and control rules in data-poor contexts, this has typically been done on a case-specific basis. There remains a need for general guidance on formulating control rules that link empirical indicators with suitable management responses. Additionally, in the data-poor context, most literature has focused on empirical indicators and assessments, with less focus on decision rules and the incorporation of indicators and assessments in a harvest strategy framework. This review considers a range of harvest strategy options, focusing on empirical indicators and decision rules available for data-poor species and fisheries. These clearly illustrate that a paucity of information is not a reason to avoid developing harvest strategies, and that a range of pragmatic approaches are available regardless of the available data, life-history of the target species, nature of fishing operations, or the available research capacity. There is considerable scope for further work in this field, but arguably there is a comprehensive repository of approaches and decision rules that, when combined with the guidelines, form a solid foundation and toolkit for all but the most data-poor species and fisheries.},

A number of United Nations resolutions have drawn attention to the need to monitor and reduce discards and unwanted bycatch, in order to assess the impact of discards on marine resources and promote technologies and other means of reducing them. This paper provides an update of the quantity of discards in the world's marine fisheries based on a fishery-by-fishery approach. The previous FAO estimate of discards at a global level, based on data prior to 1994, is now considered outdated. The present study re-estimates discards at a global level using information from a broad range of fisheries in all continents. Selected policy and technical issues are highlighted and suggestions made for future actions. A road map for achieving further precision in the global estimate is described and associated initiatives are outlined.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT SUMMARY The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reforms agreed by European Union (EU) ministers include a discard ban where fishers will be required to land all fish they catch. The ban is expected to reduce the risk of capturing unwanted and low-value biomass species, and therefore should make fishing more environmentally and economically sustainable. The implications of introducing a discards ban may be gauged by assessing the practical and economic issues surrounding whether discards not destined for human consumption can be used once landed. Interviews with company managers established the attitude of the main commercial outlets towards suitability of, and interest in using discards. Results indicate that opportunities for using discards include reduction to fishmeal and fish oil, ensiling, composting, anaerobic digestion with energy recovery, and freezing (prior to use as bait). In the UK, nine main outlets expressed interest in using discards as raw materials to process into animal, pet and aqua feed; organic fertilizer; frozen bait; and other products, such as renewable energy generation. Estimates of discard quantities from English fleets show that most of the outlets are not located close to the main landing ports where the discards would likely come ashore. However, most outlets have extensive established transport links, which would enable them to cover even the remote ports. Preliminary analysis on cost of discarding shows that a discard ban will lead to increases in annual operating costs for fishers ranging from GB{\pounds} 1709–90 959 yr−1 ({\pounds}1 = US{\$} 1.52, May 2013). Assuming that discards are processed for fishmeal, fetching c. GB{\pounds} 130 t−1, then majority of the fishers will make losses in their fishing operations. Such losses could lead fishers to adopt more selective gears in order to avoid catching unwanted species and thereby help conserve the marine environment. Finding potential uses for discards is important in the context of the proposed land-all catch policy under the reformed CFP, but the primary goal of government should be to prevent the capture of unwanted fish.},

abstract = {An algebraic model is presented that allows comparison of changes in total catch, stock-specific catch, and stock-specific harvest rate for various fisheries harvesting the same stock of concern under conditions of change in the stock's abundance. The model operates without detailed estimates of each fishery's complete stock composition and without ongoing assessment of each component stock's biomass or population size. Rather, observations or assumptions of the proportional contribution (rho sub x) of the stock of concern to each fishery's total catch, combined with presumptions of change in that stock's abundance (theta sub x), are sufficient to illustrate proportional changes in catch and harvest rate under management prescriptions for constant harvest rate and for constant total catch. Results indicate that mixed stock fisheries, especially those with low rho sub x from a particular stock, are only slightly affected by and exert very small influence upon changes in abundance of that stock, even if total harvests remain constant. In contrast, single stock fisheries with high rho sub x are more directly affected by and exert more substantial influence upon changes in the stock's abundance. Because the presence of other stocks in a mixed stock fishery dilutes its relationship to any stock in particular, such a fishery may not need to be managed nearly so precisely as another fishery for which a common stock supports the bulk of the harvest.},

abstract = {During fishing operations, fish are often caught that were not targeted. When the species in question are of low value, or protected, this ‘by-catch' is often thrown overboard as ‘discards', the retained part of the catch constituting the landings. The amounts of fish discarded are generally highly area- and gear-specific, but can be high; for example, discards in tropical shrimp trawl fisheries may be one order of magnitude higher than the retained catch. The latest analysis undertaken by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations suggests that global discards have declined in recent years, indicating that wastage is being reduced in global fisheries operations. By all accounts, reducing waste is a good thing, and hence good news. Nevertheless, if one considers this decline in discards in conjunction with the reported decline in global fisheries landings over the last decade, it becomes evident that total global fisheries catches (consisting of landings plus discards) might have declined at a substantially steeper rate than previously thought. This could be bad news, if it is indicative of declining total availability of fish. While acknowledging the high uncertainty in both discard and landings data at the global scale through time, the present observation may serve as an urgent reminder that global fisheries may be in more trouble than we thought previously.},

abstract = {Commercial capture fisheries produce huge quantities of offal, as well as undersized and unwanted catch in the form of discards. Declines in global catches and legislation to ban discarding will significantly reduce discards, but this subsidy supports a large scavenger community. Understanding the potential impact of declining discards for scavengers should feature in an eco-system based approach to fisheries management, but requires greater knowledge of scavenger/fishery interactions. Here we use bird-borne cameras, in tandem with GPS loggers, to provide a unique view of seabird/fishery interactions. 20,643 digital images (one min21) from ten bird-borne cameras deployed on central place northern gannets Morus bassanus revealed that all birds photographed fishing vessels. These were large (.15 m) boats, with no small-scale vessels. Virtually all vessels were trawlers, and gannets were almost always accompanied by other scavenging birds. All individuals exhibited an Area-Restricted Search (ARS) during foraging, but only 42{\{}{\%}{\}} of ARS were associated with fishing vessels, indicating much ‘natural' foraging. The proportion of ARS behaviours associated with fishing boats were higher for males (81{\{}{\%}{\}}) than females (30{\{}{\%}{\}}), although the reasons for this are currently unclear. Our study illustrates that fisheries form a very important component of the prey-landscape for foraging gannets and that a discard ban, such as that proposed under reforms of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, may have a significant impact on gannet behaviour, particularly males. However, a continued reliance on ‘natural' foraging suggests the ability to switch away from scavenging, but only if there is sufficient food to meet their needs in the absence of a discard subsidy},

It analyses the policy's advantages and disadvantages, and its political, environmental and scien- tific consequences. It argues that an increase in public awareness, due to public cam- paigns against fisheries discards, has focused managers' attention onto a symptom of fisheries mismanagement, rather than on its underlying causes of over-exploitation and lack of fisheries control. This has distorted the discussion of the reform of the Com- mon Fisheries Policy and potentially undermined its provisions relating to discards.},

One way to address the problem of wasteful discarding of ﬁsh at sea is to initiate pilot projects to trial potential solutions, such as selective gear, area closures, discard bans and data enhancement, which could subsequently be adopted by the ﬁshing industry, either voluntarily or through regulation. However, such pilot projects are often difﬁcult both to set up and to sustain through to completion and implementation. This study reviewed 15 discard-related pilot projects to ﬁnd out what were the most important determinants of their success or lack of it, and to recommend ways in which the prospects of future pilots could be improved. The review identiﬁes the seven most important factors associated with the viability of the pilot projects - ﬁsheries crises; incentivization; funding; expertise; leadership; and enforcement - and shows how ﬁsheries regulators could take steps to reinforce these factors – by faster responses to crises; more incentives and funding; greater use of ﬁshers' knowledge and leadership; and better enforcement mechanisms.},

abstract = {The current status of the whiskery shark (Furgaleus macki) stock in south-western Australia was assessed using an age and sex structured model. The best estimates of total and mature biomass in 1997/1998 were 38.8{\%} of virgin, and 23.0{\%} of virgin, respectively. The 95{\%} con{\textregistered}dence intervals for total biomass were 22.7±47.2{\%}, and for mature biomass were 13.4±36.4{\%}. Thirteen scenarios were used to test the sensitivity of the model to catch and effort, biological, and gear parameters. The estimates of current biomass were most sensitive to variations in catch and effort data. A scenario testing the use of raw catch and effort data produced unrealistically low estimates of current biomass, while a scenario testing the hypothesis that there had been no ef{\textregistered}ciency increases in the {\textregistered}shery over time indicated that biomass was currently higher than indicated by the best estimate. The remainder of the scenarios tested produced estimates of total biomass between 32 and 40{\%} of virgin, and mature biomass between 21 and 30{\%} of virgin. Risk analysis was used to test three biological reference points: that the total biomass would be at least 40{\%} of virgin by 2010/2011 (a management committee target), that the total biomass in 2010/2011 will not be below that of 1996/1997, and that the stock would collapse. The results of risk analysis indicates that to achieve at least a 50{\%} probability for the {\textregistered}rst two biological reference points, annual catches would need to be below 190 tonnes until 2010. The probability of a population crash before 2010 is approximately 5{\%} when future catches are 175 tonnes, and greater than 50{\%} when catches are above 280 tonnes. Risk analysis indicates that there is a need to substantially reduce commercial catches if the target set by the management committee is to be met},

abstract = {High-grading is the decision by fishers to discard fish of low value that allows them to land more valuable fish. A literature review showed high-grading is reported in commercial and non-commercial fisheries around the world, although the number of observations is small. High-grading occurs in fisheries that are restricted to land their total catch due to management, market or physical constraints. Using the mixed flatfish fishery as a model system, a dynamic state variable model simulation showed that high-grading of certain grades occurs throughout the year when their ex-vessel price is low. High-grading increases with the degree of quota restriction, while the level of over-quota discard- ing is unrelated to the quota level. The size composition of the high-graded catch differs from the landed catch. Due to the differences in the seasonal variation in size specific ex-vessel price, the effect of quota restrictions on the size composition of the discarded catch is non- linear. High-grading is difficult to detect for the fishery inspection as it occurs on-board during the short period when the catch is processed. We conclude that high- grading is under-reported in fish stocks managed by restrictive quota, undermining the quality of stock assessments and sustainable management of exploited fish stocks.},

We find that, as predicted by theory, areas with higher monetary and non-monetary costs have consistently higher catch rates than areas with lower costs. We show that this theory also predicts that an increase in price would result in an overall increase in catch rate, and suggest that in fisheries with spatial variation in costs, catch rates may be determined as much by economic factors as biological ones.},

A simulation strategy for fleet dynamics in Australia's northern prawn fishery: effort allocation at two scales. – {\{}ICES{\}} Journal of Marine Science, 66: 631–645. We describe simple and effective methods for simulating the movement of a fishing fleet, the spatio-temporal allocation of effort, in the context of harvest policy evaluation. Vessel movements are simulated in a manner that can balance established seasonal fishing patterns with the influence of perceived local variations in abundance. In the longer term, the model adapts smoothly to changes in fleet size and price fluctuations in critical resources, such as fuel. Given an initial allocation of effort at a fine temporal (but coarse spatial) scale, as needed for projecting stock dynamics, a second phase assigns the effort at a finer spatial (but coarser temporal) scale for environmental impact assessment. The first phase is based on a discrete-state, time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, with transition probabilities following a multiple logistic model. Although the ideas are generic, the method has been developed for the specific case of Australia's northern prawn fishery, which is used to motivate and describe the method. The approach, in a harvest policy evaluation context, is novel in that it uses economic projections (not surrogates) to reflect realistically the recent pressures many fishing industries are under to change their spatial fishing pattern in response to global fuel price fluctuations.},

abstract = {This study presents the first comprehensive estimation of discard amounts in the Galician fishing fleet, in order to provide an integral view of this increasing environmental problem at a regional scale. Subsequently, a series of improvement actions relating to discard minimization are suggested with the goal of enhancing the performance of the Galician fishing fleet through discard minimization. Discard estimates were constructed individually for the different Galician fisheries by aggregating primary data obtained from a total of 89 fishing vessels and secondary data for those fleets that were not directly sampled. Results showed that roughly 60,250. t of marine organisms were discarded by the Galician fleet in 2008, representing 16.9{\%} of the total capture. Moreover, an important percentage of these discards were linked mainly to trawling vessels and to a lesser extent, to certain long lining fisheries. Therefore, improved management measures in target stocks should take into account the fact that alternative fishing gears other than trawl nets may reduce the amount of discards for certain species. This estimation may improve the assessment of stocks and help to quantify the damage that discards may have on wild ecosystems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Discards refer to the part of the catch not retained on board during commercial fishing operations, but returned to the sea. The proposed European Union Common Fisheries Policy reform, to be implemented in 2014, sets out a gradual elimination of discards by reducing unwanted catches and ensuring that all catches are landed. To develop successful discard mitigation measures, it is necessary to identify the reasons for discarding. Here, we have developed a simple model that can be applied to data from observer programmes (ObsPs) to establish the contribution of different drivers of discarding behaviour. The analysis makes inferences on the causes of discarding by partitioning discards into four categories based on the length of the fish and the associated regulatory restrictions. The drivers are defined as: fish discarded below the legal minimum landing size; fish for which there is no market and that do not have a minimum landing size; fish for which there are inconsistencies in market and sorting practices; and discards that can be attributed to fishers' responses to quota restrictions. The approach is applied to data generated from ObsPs from five European Member States. All the inferred drivers contribute to the total discard quantity. Their relative contributions vary widely across countries, areas, gears, and species. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Some fishery characteristics such as total discards are often inferred from data collected by at-sea observers on a subset of fishing trips. Such inference is predicated on the assumption that observed and unobserved trips are statistically exchangeable. There are two principal reasons why this may not be so. A deployment effect results from nonrandom distri- bution of observers among sampling units. An observer effect results from changes in fishing practice or location when ob- servers are present. Both effects can impact the precision and accuracy of fishery-level inferences drawn from observer data, though this is rarely addressed quantitatively. We found evidence for deployment and observer effects in Gulf of St. Lawrence fisheries. The impact of deployment bias was further quantified by resampling from fisheries data collected with 100{\%} observer coverage. We conclude that the nature of the effects observed in our study preclude merely correcting observer-collected catch data for possible biases and imprecision. Furthermore, regulatory compliance monitoring by observers in the existing program may not be completely effective. Modifications to program structure would therefore be beneficial and some suggestions are evaluated in this paper.},

abstract = {Fisheries in European Union (EU) waters have been managed under the Common Fisheries Policy since 1983. The main regulatory tool in EU fisheries management is the use of Total Allowable Catches (TACs). In principle, TACs are set according to biological scientific advice provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) which recommends catch limits with the objective of maximising catches in a sustainable manner. The objective of this paper is to compare TACs set by the EU and its Member States between 2001 and 2015 with those recommended by ICES in their annual scientific advice in order to (a) investigate the level of compliance with scientific advice by the European Council and, (b) consider whether particular Member States have received more TACs above advice than others. For the time-series analysed, the European Council set TACs above scientific advice by an average of 20{\%} per year, with around 7 out of every 10 TACs exceeding advice. Of all Member States, Denmark and the United Kingdom received the highest TACs in volume above scientific advice. Relative to the size of their TAC however, Spain and Portugal exceeded advice by the greatest percentage. Greater transparency is required to determine what takes place during the closed door negotiations and to improve the fishery sustainability credentials of the EU and its Member States.},

It additively considers marine protection coverage by conventional MPAs (cMPAs; tier 1); unconventional MPAs (uMPAs, including international Fisheries Restricted Areas - iFRAs-; tier 2); and Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OEABCMs, including national FRAs-nFRAs; tier 3). It also discusses the appropriateness of considering tiers 2 and 3 as legal and managerial tools for sustainable marine development in national reporting against international protection coverage targets. At the Mediterranean Sea scale, by mid-2015 there were 1077 cMPAs which covered 6.45{\%} of its area. At the ecoregional scale, only the Western Mediterranean ecoregion exceeds the 10{\%} coverage target. At national scale, four countries (Monaco, France, Spain and Turkey) currently exceed the 10{\%} target for their entire hypothetical Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). The cMPA designations that contribute most to Mediterranean MPA coverage are Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance (SPAMIs), the Pelagos Sanctuary, Natura 2000 sites and national designations, respectively. When considering uMPAs, the amount of marine area under protection in the Mediterranean reaches 1,632,507 km2 or roughly 64.48{\%} of the Mediterranean Sea area; all the ecoregions more than double the CBD coverage target; all countries but Malta meet the target in their inshore waters; and all countries meet the target in their whole hypothetical EEZs. Finally, nFRAs contributed 565km2 of additional protected area and made the percentage of legally protected marine area reach 64.50{\%} of the total Mediterranean Sea area.},

Firstly, annual trends in settlement were spatially analysed across the three States. In South Australian and Victorian settlement patterns were closely related. In Tasmania, settlement sites along the northeast coast were positively correlated, but showed no relationship with areas further south or in any other State. Secondly, annual settlement indices were correlated with lagged estimates of fishery recruitment. In South Australia, the strongest correlations between settlement and recruitment to legal size were observed using a 4–5- year time-lag. Within Victoria and Tasmania, the period from settlement to recruitment at 60 mmcarapace length (CL) was 2 and 3 years, respectively. The period from 60 mmto legal size was another 2–3 years, suggesting that the total time from settlement to the fishery ranges from 4–6 years in these regions. The correlation between settlement and recruitment was used to forecast future estimates of exploitable biomass in one region of South Australia. The results indicate that puerulus monitoring is a relatively robust indicator of future fishery performance and should be regarded as an important data source for rock lobster resources within south-eastern Australia},

abstract = {A landing obligation was formally implemented in the European Union (EU) for the first time, as part of the recent reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Given the reasonable success of the landing obligation in some countries such as the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, this policy is seen as a viable approach to tackle the long-recognized discarding problem in EU waters. However, there has been some debate on whether there is sufficient evidence to support the feasibility of such a measure in the EU-CFP. The EU landing obligation will implicitly include all small-scale fisheries (SSF) provided the species captured are subject to catch limits or minimum sizes (in the case of the Mediterranean). SSF were included irrespective of the fact that the discarding problem in the EU has been historically associated with medium- to large-scale fleets (in particular largely mixed species trawl fisheries). Additionally, past experiences with a discard ban policy are still limited to specific countries and/or specific fisheries. This paper examined the appropriateness and feasibility of the recently implemented EU landing obligation in SSF. The effects in the long-term are unpredictable, but available evidence suggests that in the short to medium-term a landing obligation is likely to bring more negative social, economic and ecological impacts than benefits.},

abstract = {The reduction of discards in European fisheries has been identified as a specific objective of the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. To reduce the uncertainty in catch data and the socially unacceptable waste of resources that results from the disposal of catch at sea, a policy to ban discards has been proposed. Discard bans are currently implemented in Alaska, British Columbia, New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. Experience from these countries highlights that a policy of mandatory landings can result in a reduction in discards, but relies upon a high level of surveillance or economic incentives to encourage fishers to land more of their catch. Discard bans will also not result in long term benefits to stocks unless total removals are reduced, through the avoidance of undersized, non-commercial or over quota catch. Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more selective fishing. Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, selective fishing will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Several fisheries across the world are managed by a quota regime. These quotas can be set yearly, monthly, weekly or daily. However, for some fish species demand seasonality may occur, which should be taken into consideration in the establishment of the quota (especially in those fisheries managed by daily or monthly quotas). This would allow fishermen to catch more fish at times of the year with higher demand in detriment of periods when demand is low. The present work investigates the existence of demand seasonality for bivalves from the artisanal dredge fleet. This fleet operates along the entire coast of the Portugal mainland. The analysis of fleets' revenue efficiency is assessed with Data Envelopment Analysis models, and the monthly seasonality effects on the revenue efficiency were tested using a Tobit regression. The results revealed that on the South coast there is a strong demand in the summer whereas on the western coast (northwest and southwest fishing areas) demand increases during Christmas and New Year festivities. Since this fishery is managed by weekly/daily quotas, it is proposed that these quotas should be redistributed in order to adjust them to periods of higher demand, thereby increasing the profitability of the vessels. The approach followed could be applied to similar fisheries worldwide. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Analyses of global fish stocks paint a mixed picture of success, with some holding fishery management responsible for the poor status of many stocks [1-3] or predicting widespread collapse [1, 4]. Some suggest a stable [5] or improving situation [6] in certain jurisdictions. The debate is particularly polarized in the European Union, where the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) has been criticized for failing to protect stocks [2, 7-10], while others argue that a rebuilding process is underway [11, 12]. We show that substantial change in stock trends occurred in the area around the turn of the century: since then, the fishing pressure (as measured by the exploitation rate) has reduced continuously and there have been increases in biomass, demonstrating the potential for stock recovery. In 2011, for the first time, the majority of assessed stocks, where reference points are defined, were fished sustainably. The reductions in fishing pressure were associated with declines in fishing effort. The last reform of the CFP, in 2002, introduced effort control as part of more enforceable management measures, which were also based on longer-term plans. Further reforms to the CFP are currently being developed, so it is important, when correcting its weaknesses, to also acknowledge and build on the success of a major reduction in the fishing pressure on European fish stocks. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {There is an increasing pressure on the fisheries to avoid bycatch and discards. In the EU this is seen in landing obligations in the new Common Fisheries Policy. The European fisheries are thus under pressure to be highly selective both in adjusting catches to the individual or collective quota combinations and to be size selective in order to optimise the economic outcome of the available quota. This paper proposes a strategy of time-place selectivity by sharing real-time data and information between vessels about areas with high abundance of unwanted species and sizes (hotspots). The paper examines use of time-place regulation, risks/benefits of sharing knowledge and experiences from a previous real-time information sharing system as basis for developing the four models for fisher's sharing of information. The models differ with regard to data and information collection methods, who owns and access the data and hotspot warnings. The models are tested through a discussion of the possible application of the models in the context of the nephrops trawl fishery in Kattegat and Skagerrak. Based on this the models are proposed as possible tools for the fishing industry and managers when adjusted to specific local conditions, and a recommendation for policy support of development of information sharing systems is outlined.},

To understand the importance of discards for local L. argentatus and L. fuscus populations, single-item discard experiments were performed at four offshore distances from the gullery of the Port of Zeebrugge, at four different stages of the breeding season (May to August 2011). We compared flock composition during discarding with the distribution of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, with respect to offshore distance from the colony as reflected by an 11-year (2002–2013) dataset of standardised ship-based surveys. Consumption of discards depended on the type of fish that was discarded, but prey selectivity by adults was reduced during the chick rearing stage. A generalised linear mixed model identified the number of scavengers following the vessel, the proportion of adults and of Herring Gulls in the flock and the frequency of food robbery events interacting with the stage of the breeding season as affecting the variation in flat- fish consumption. Shifts in scavenger flock composition and discard consump- tion between stages of the breeding season are likely linked to variation in food requirements of the gull population along the season and to dispersal patterns towards the end of summer. Nutrient requirements of breeding adults peak during the chick rearing stage, making this a key period in terms of dependence of the breeding parents on discarded fish as food source.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nKey},

This, combined with a stock that has declined dramatically over the past 30 years, has led to numerous technical regulations being introduced to reduce the capture of juveniles and thus discards. One method that has been widely adopted in the Baltic Sea has been to improve gear selectivity, subsequently allowing young individuals to escape capture. To understand the effects that changes to gear selectivity and minimum landing size have had on discard rates, as well as the effects of a range of additional explanatory factors, generalized additive mixed models were used. Gear regulation changes enforced in the Danish demersal trawl fishery in the Baltic Sea and other factors, such as minimum landings size, juvenile abundance, catch mass, price, and their spatial and temporal distribution, were found to significantly affect discard rates. The newest and currently legislated gears were identified as having the lowest discard rates. The increase in minimum landing size from 35 to 38 cm has increased discard rates.},

The first section highlights elements of the discard ban in the reformed EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The second section presents two initiatives for cod avoidance in Kattegat; a fisher initiative sharing information about cod bycatch which could lead to real time closures in areas with high bycatch of juveniles, for vessels with low cod quota to avoid catch of all cod, and a Danish Swedish Government initiative of permanent and temporary area closures in Kattegat. The third section discusses the lessons learned in the light of implementation of the discard ban. The fourth section sums up the lessons learned; Regional measures of implementation of the discard ban should include all vessels with quota in the region to be regarded fair and the goals should be clear, not least when the descriptors of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which might be more intangible for the fishers, are part of the goal of the measures. If incentives created by the regulation are stable over at least a few years the fishers and fishers' organisations are more capable at being active partners in developing the systems that support the discard ban. An example from the examined initiatives are the outline of a fleet information system, providing the skipper with information about hotspots of unwanted species allowing him to make a better plan for the selective fishery based on more qualified information. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, discarded fish are food for a range of scavenging species; so, ending discarding may have ecological consequences. Here we investigate the sensitivity of ecological effects to discarding policies using an ecosystem model of the North Sea--a region where 30-40{\%} of trawled fish catch is currently discarded. We show that landing the entire catch while fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks. However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks. Our results highlight the importance of considering the broader ecosystem consequences of fishery management policy, since species interactions may dissipate or negate intended benefits.},

However, some exemptions may apply, and to this end a discards management plan is required. Based on the recent joint recommendations for discard management plans in the Mediterranean, it was identified that in order to compile an eligible future discard management plan for the Mediterranean fisheries and apply for any exemption, a series of steps will have to be taken towards defining a legal framework under which Mediterranean fisheries can be assessed for their performance. The current system seems inadequate to document actual catches, urges to be updated and above all disqualifies Mediterranean fisheries from been granted any eligible discard management plan. The current long-standing legislative framework, tailored to deal with the 'peculiarities' of Mediterranean fisheries by establishing an effort-based management scheme, has now become an immovable obstacle towards dealing with unwanted catches. Mediterranean stakeholders will have to decide if it is worth moving from an effort-based to a catch-based management system, or if the benefits realized by the former would be difficult to be counterbalanced under any other system.},

abstract = {With the development of the ecosystem approach to fisheries, improving fishing selectivity has increasingly been put forward as an objective for management. The aim of this paper is to clarify the limits of fishing selectivity and its use in fisheries management. Fishing selectivity would be better apprehended if restricted to the catching process only, not to the utilisation that is made of the catch once onboard, which falls under catch utilisation. Confusion would be further limited if fishing selectivity is restricted to the fishing operation scale, while exploitation pattern, i.e. the distribution of fishing mortality at the population or community level, applies to larger scales. Fishing selectively is minimizing bycatch - catching primarily the fishing trip targets. Since the ecological consequences of maximising the target catch relative to bycatch remain unknown at integrated scales, fishing selectivity cannot be used as an objective in itself. However, its small scale, high manageability and good understanding make it a convenient instrument to reach management objectives at large scales. Selectivity can serve to manage what is extracted from the ecosystem and thus what can be used, and/or to manage what is left in the ecosystem and how fishing impacts it. Different factors affect fishing selectivity, catch utilisation and exploitation patterns, some of them are manageable and thus can be used to move towards these objectives. Management tools are diverse, but need to be integrated to meet large-scale objectives. The complexity of dealing with large scales incurs a need to develop the available knowledge on exploitation patterns and catch utilisation to be able to adequately manage and monitor progress toward selectivity-related objectives.},

The increase in the price of fuel over the last decade, together with the volatility and fluctuation in the price for a barrel of crude oil, makes fuel costs one of the main concerns of ship-owners. As a response, different initiatives have been undertaken, with the aim to reduce such fuel dependency. The present contribution presents the feasibility study of the use of different magnetic devices for fuel treatment, in order to improve the energy efficiency of fishing vessels and reduce exhaust emissions. According to manufacturers, fuel treatment devices provide three effects: reduction in fuel consumption; reduction in exhaust gas emissions; and improvement of engine performance by reducing maintenance costs. Three independent magnetic devices have been mounted and tested on three different 4 stroke compression ignition diesel engines. The first device was tested in an engine located on a test bench; it was operated under controlled laboratory conditions. The second, installed on board a trawler fishing vessel operating in the Mediterranean Sea; and the third, on board a representative vessel of the trolling fishing fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Ocean. In all cases, the potential fuel-saving ({\~{}}2{\%}) and exhaust gas emissions ({\~{}}0.6{\%}) reduction was lower than expected by manufacturers. The aim of this contribution is to provide ship-owners with scientific knowledge to make informed decisions, when investing in energy-saving technologies.},

In this paper, we use a bioeconomic model to examine how species-transformation provisions affect sustainability and profitability of a multispecies fishery. We base parameterization of the model loosely on management of the Icelandic demersal fishery, which currently employs one of the broadest implementations of species transformations. To represent fisher behaviour in each year, effort is allocated among two or three m{\'{e}}tiers, such that total profit for that year is maximized. Each m{\'{e}}tier represents a combination of three species' catchability rates that define which species are targeted by each m{\'{e}}tier and how independent a species' catch rate is from that of other species. Assumptions regarding the degree to which fishers can target specific species by shifting effort between m{\'{e}}tiers, as well as how relative profitability among m{\'{e}}tiers varies, are paramount to understanding more generally how fishing regulations such as species transformations can be expected to change fishing patterns. This constraint depends not only on how strongly associated species catches are within a m{\'{e}}tier but also on relative species abundance and what alternate m{\'{e}}tiers are available.},

abstract = {Commercial fishing is heavily fuel dependant. The increase in the fuel price, together with the stock decline, occupational risks of fishing, the possibilities of finding a different future for new generations, are some of the reasons that have made fishing arrive at its 'survival limits', in many parts of Europe. This contribution aims at providing shipowners and researcher with the experience of undertaking energy audits, to reduce the fuel bill of fishing vessels. In order to do so, 3 fishing vessels were assessed comprehensively, for 2010-2012, to determine their energy consumption flow. The results indicate that energy consumption depends upon: (a) the structure and size of the vessel; (b) the engine conditions and use patterns; (c) the fishing gears used; (d) the fishing and trip patterns; (e) the distance to the fishing ground; (f) target species and their migration routes; and (g) the traditions onboard. Likewise, no generalisation can be made regarding the way energy is consumed by onboard equipment/machinery when different fishing gears are compared. Energy audits will need to be site-specific and to include sufficient data to obtain representative results; these are likely to be more than in land-based industries, due to the peculiarities of this sector. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An analysis of 38 bottom trawl hauls at depths of 251-737 m off the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean) during autumn 2002 and spring 2003 was used to compare the species and size selectivity of 40-mm diamond- and square-mesh codends under commercial conditions. There was no difference in the catch composition or the yield that could be attributable to mesh shape, although the percentage of total and commercial species discarded with a diamond mesh was higher than with a square mesh. At least in the short term, the escapement ratio and the economic loss with the diamond mesh were lower than with square mesh, but economic efficiency was no different between them. For all the main species compared, except one flatfish, size selectivity parameters were lower for the diamond- than for the square-mesh codend. Selectivity values for the one flatfish species were similar. From the results it is concluded that, within the context of precautionary management, introduction of a 40-mm square mesh in the codend could be an appropriate and plausible measure to improve the state of the resources exploited by the deepwater crustacean trawl fishery of the upper slope off the Balearic Islands, and to reduce the impact of the fishery on the ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {It has been widely acknowledged that fishery discard practices constitute a purposeless waste of valuable living resources, which plays an important role in the depletion of marine populations. Furthermore, discarding may have a number of adverse ecological impacts in marine ecosystems, provoking changes in the overall structure of trophic webs and habitats, which in turn could pose risks for the sustainability of current fisheries. The present review aims to describe the current state-of-the-art in discards research, with particular emphasis on the needs and challenges associated with the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) in European waters. We briefly review the international and European policy contexts of discarding, how discard data are collected and incorporated into stock assessments, selectivity in fishing and the main consequences of discarding for ecosystem dynamics. We then review implementation issues related to reducing discards under the EAFM and the associated scientific challenges, and conclude with some comments on lessons learned and future directions.},

abstract = {The selective properties of a bottom trawl fitted with a 70 mm diamond mesh codend and a 100 mm top square mesh panel (SMP) for hake (Merluccius merluccius), pouting (Trisopterus luscus and Trisopterus minutus) and red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) were investigated over the period 2011-2013. The experiments were carried out over three separate cruises aboard two commercial Basque bottom otter trawlers in the Bay of Biscay area. "Fall-through" experiments were also undertaken to estimate the potential size selection of 100 mm square mesh for the same species. Results from the "Fall-through" experiments and the at-sea selectivity cruises demonstrated that a 100 mm SMP has the potential to enable undersized and immature individuals to escape through the meshes. However, the selectivity cruises demonstrated that in practice, the SMP was largely ineffective at releasing undersized individuals as only a small fraction of the fish entering the trawl attempted to escape through the SMP during their drift towards the codend. The fraction attempting to escape was quantified by the "SMP contact probability" and was less than 4{\%} for hake and red mullet and less than 15{\%} for pouting. Furthermore, for each species, the release potential for the diamond mesh codend was found to be significantly lower than the length-at-maturity and the legal minimum conservation reference size. On average, the proportions of the total catch of undersized individuals of each species retained by the gear, were 52{\%}, 17{\%} and 45{\%} for hake, pouting and red mullet respectively. Based on our findings, we conclude that the gear currently deployed by the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay is largely ineffective at releasing undersized hake, pouting and red mullet. The introduction of the obligation to land all catches, under the 2013 reform of the EU Common Fisheries policy will create new challenges for the Basque bottom otter trawl fleet and thereby an incentive to improve selectivity to avoid unwanted catches of undersized individuals.},

abstract = {In 2011, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council implemented an individual transferrable quota (ITQ) system for the US West Coast groundfish trawl fleet. Under the ITQ system, each vessel now receives transferrable annual allocations of quota for 29 groundfish species, including target and bycatch species. Here we develop an ecosystem and fleet dynamics model to identify which components of an ITQ systemare likely to drive responses in effort, target species catch, bycatch, and overall profitability. In the absence of penalties for discarding over-quota fish, ITQs lead to large increases in fishing effort and bycatch. The penalties fishermen expect for exceeding quota have the largest effect on fleet behaviour, capping effort and total bycatch. Quota prices for target or bycatch species have lesser impacts on fishing dynamics, even up to bycatch quota prices of {\$}50 kg21. Ports that overlap less with bycatch species can increase effort under individual quotas, while other ports decrease effort. Relative to a prior management system, ITQs with penalties for exceeding quotas lead to increased target species landings and lower bycatch, but with strong variation among species. The model illustrates how alternative fishery management policies affect profitability, sustainability and the ecosystem. Keywords:},

abstract = {A school of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) was conditioned to circulate a large swimming pool tank, passing through a constricting funnel of netting on each circuit. The funnel comprised two panels of netting (400 mm square mesh) narrowing to a central gap (0.6 m X 0.9 m). The proportions of fish passing through the meshes of the funnel were noted in three experimental conditions. When given a clear path through the funnel almost all the fish avoided the meshes and over 92{\%} of the fish crowded through the gap. When faced with a fine mesh (35 mm) netting panel blocking the gap, all fish passed through the meshes of the funnel itself. When a black-walled open-ended tunnel was positioned beyond the opening of the gap all the fish passed through the meshes of the netting panels and none through the gap and black tunnel. These experiments confirm that fish keep clear of netting panels and are reluctant to pass through large meshes when a clearer passage is available to them. They also show that fish will pass through meshes when the alternative route is blocked or appears in some way (black tunnel effect or visual illusion) to be a less clear route. The results are discussed in relation to the role of fish behaviour in the selective efficiency of full-scale fishing gears.},

The codends tested were 152, 165 and 178 mm diamond mesh codends, and 165 and 178 mm square mesh codends. A new hydrodynamic codend cover, which was expanded by 12 water-borne kites, was developed, tested and used during the codend mesh selectivity studies. Eighty-six successful tows were completed for the five codends. This paper describes results for two species of roundfish - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and four species of flounders - American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). The results indicate that larger codend mesh sizes retained larger fish for all species for both diamond and square mesh codends. The mesh shape (diamond or square) has no significant effect on the 50{\%} retention length (L50) for roundfish (P {\textgreater} 0.1) while the square mesh codends have significantly smaller L50s for flounders (P {\textless} 0.001). The square mesh codend has a narrower selection range (SR) than the corresponding diamond mesh codend for both cod and haddock. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An individual-based model that simulates fish selection processes in diamond mesh cod-ends of towed fishing gears is outlined. The model is implemented in a computer program called PRESEMO. A typical simulation can be carried out within a few minutes on a personal computer. Up to four different populations of fish entering the cod-end during a tow can be accounted for. Each fish is assigned a weight, girth, width and height according to its length, and is assumed to have an elliptical cross-section. Fish are allocated a period of travel time down the cod-end, a period for swimming in the cod-end without being exhausted, a period between escape attempts and a packing density for those swimming ahead of the catch. An escape attempt is deemed successful if a fish can pass through the mesh opening at the position in the cod-end where the escape attempt takes place. The mesh opening value is obtained from information on the shape of the cod-end, which depends on the catch weight. The cod-end shape is updated dynamically as the catch builds up during the tow. During a simulation the selection process is continually visualized, that is, the entry, movement and escape attempts of individual fish are shown as well as the changes in the cod-end geometry. At the end of a simulation, a logistic function is automatically fitted to the selection data to obtain estimates of the 50{\%} retention length and the selection range. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The bottom-trawl fishery in Portuguese continental waters is a multi-species one targeting benthic, demersal and pelagic fish, and cephalopods, where the blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou and the longspine snipefish, Macroramphosus scolopax often constitute a major by-catch problem. The simultaneous capture of commercial and by-catch species having very different length ranges, body shapes and behavioural patterns towards the gear raises complex management issues, which cannot be addressed only by controlling the codend mesh size. A sorting system comprising a modified Nordm{\o}re grid, 30 mm bar spacing, used alone or together with a 100 mm square-mesh window was evaluated as a by-catch reduction device, during 26 hauls carried out off the Portuguese west coast, in September 2003, on board the R/V 'Capric{\'{o}}rnio'. Demersal and pelagic species displayed contrasting reactions towards the grid. The former (hake, Merluccius merluccius; pouting, Trisopterus luscus; dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula) contacted the grid and were size-selected, while most of the latter (Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus; horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus; blue whiting and snipefish) were conducted along the grid and passed through its upper opening into the codend. When the square-mesh window was placed just behind the top opening of the grid, a large escapement of pelagic fish took place. Results suggest that by reducing the grid's bar spacing and the window's mesh size used in the present trials, it will still be possible to reduce the catch of undersized demersal species, such as the hake, and promote the escape of blue whiting, while retaining most of the commercially valuable species. However, it was also evident that no such system will simultaneously solve the problem of large by-catches of longspine snipefish. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Poor selectivity of demersal trawls targeting fish, crustaceans and cephalopods in Mersin Bay, Turkey, (and more broadly for most Mediterranean demersal trawlers) is a significant concern. The majority of the boats working in the Mersin Bay trawl fishery use traditional gears with 44. mm mesh size hand-woven slack knotted codends in which approximately 50{\%} of the catch by weight and 70{\%} by numbers are discarded. The present study compares size selectivity of a commonly used hand-woven codend and three alternative machine woven codends (40. mm square mesh; 44. mm and 50. mm diamond mesh) for seven commercial species: red mullet (Mullus barbatus); brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis); common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus); goldband goatfish (Upeneus moluccensis); Randall's threadfin bream (Nemipterus randalli); green tiger prawn (Penaeus semisulcatus); and speckled shrimp (Metapenaeus monoceros). A total of 87 hauls were conducted using a covered codend method in 2011. Short term commercial loss for 31 marketed species resulting from switching from the commercial codend to each alternative codend, was estimated. Results show that size selectivity of the commercial codend is rather poor for almost all the marketed species. The 40. mm square mesh codend is the best alternative for the majority of the marketed species in terms of releasing juveniles. We estimate a commercial loss of 17{\%} in landing values if this codend is used.},

abstract = {Monthly monitoring of puerulus settlement across South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania has been undertaken since the early 1990s. Firstly, annual trends in settlement were spatially analysed across the three States. In South Australian and Victorian settlement patterns were closely related. In Tasmania, settlement sites along the northeast coast were positively correlated, but showed no relationship with areas further south or in any other State. Secondly, annual settlement indices were correlated with lagged estimates of fishery recruitment. In South Australia, the strongest correlations between settlement and recruitment to legal size were observed using a 4–5- year time-lag. Within Victoria and Tasmania, the period from settlement to recruitment at 60 mmcarapace length (CL) was 2 and 3 years, respectively. The period from 60 mmto legal size was another 2–3 years, suggesting that the total time from settlement to the fishery ranges from 4–6 years in these regions. The correlation between settlement and recruitment was used to forecast future estimates of exploitable biomass in one region of South Australia. The results indicate that puerulus monitoring is a relatively robust indicator of future fishery performance and should be regarded as an important data source for rock lobster resources within south-eastern Australia},

abstract = {A rapid decrease of the stock of Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) has provided the incentive to improve the size selectivity in the trawl fishery. Use of escape windows is permitted in the legislation to give means of improving the size selectivity of cod as an alternative to a traditional standard codend. The history of the use of escape windows in the Baltic Sea cod fishery is reviewed. The present escape windows do not function optimally. The objective of this new experiment was to compare an improved design of escape window, which is placed in the upper panel, with that of standard codend. Three standard codends, with 105, 120 and 140 mm nominal mesh size, and three window codends, with 110, 125 and 135 mm window nominal mesh size, were tested during sea trials conducted in June and July from a commercial trawler using a twin trawl rig and the covered codend technique. A fixed and random effects model of the codend selectivity was formulated to analyse the results and determine the effects of codend type, mesh size and other recorded variables. L50 and SR increased significantly with the mesh size. L50 was significantly increased and SR significantly reduced for a window codend with the same window mesh size (WMS) as that of a standard codend. The L50 of the standard codends decreased with catch weight. An unexplained port-starboard effect was found for the window codends where the L50 depended on which of the two trawls the codend was attached to. The potential of these escape windows as a management tool to improve the size selectivity in the Baltic cod fishery is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The adoption of fisheries closures and gear restrictions in the conservation of coral reefs may be limited by poor understanding of the economic profitability of competing economic uses of marine resources. Over the past 12 years, I evaluated the effects of gear regulation and fisheries closures on per person and per area incomes from fishing in coral reefs of Kenya. In two of my study areas, the use of small-meshed beach seines was stopped after 6 years; one of these areas was next to a fishery closure. In my third study area, fishing was unregulated. Fishing yields on per capita daily wet weight basis were 20{\%} higher after seine-net fishing was stopped. The per person daily fishing income adjacent to the closed areas was 14 and 22{\%} higher than the fishing income at areas with only gear restrictions before and after the seine-net restriction, respectively. Incomes differed because larger fish were captured next to the closed area and the price per weight (kilograms) increased as fish size increased and because catches adjacent to the closure contained fish species of higher market value. Per capita incomes were 41 and 135{\%} higher for those who fished in gear-restricted areas and near-closed areas, respectively, compared with those who fished areas with no restrictions. On a per unit area basis (square kilometers), differences in fishing income among the three areas were not large because fishing effort increased as the number of restrictions decreased. Changes in catch were, however, larger and often in the opposite direction expected from changes in effort alone. For example, effort declined 21{\%} but nominal profits per square kilometer (not accounting for inflation) increased 29{\%} near the area with gear restrictions. Gear restrictions also reduced the cost of fishing and increased the proportion of self-employed fishers.},

abstract = {The Nephrops fishery in the Bay of Biscay is an important commercial fishery which generates large amounts of discards owing to the use of small mesh trawls. To reduce discards, French trawlers were equipped with a variety of selective devices, from 2005 onwards. This study examines their efficacy using data from the French on-board observer programme, 2003 – 2010. Generalized linear models were built for catches, discards, and landings of Nephrops and hake, controlling for the other factors which drive the variability in these variables. A dorsal square-mesh panel meant to let small hake escape did not affect hake catch, but was found to decrease Nephrops catches and discards. Among the devices intended to reduce Nephrops discards, the flexible grid was the most efficient, as it decreased catches and discards in large proportions while increasing land-ings but this result was supported by a small number of observations; a larger mesh size in the codend (80 mm instead of 70) slightly decreased Nephrops discards; and a ventral square-mesh panel was not found to affect catch or discards of either species. The design of the on-board observer programme was meant to estimate discard amounts, which limited their utilization to investigate factors for discarding.},

abstract = {The objectives were to measure roundfish selectivity and to test if square-mesh windows inserted in the codend could improve the selectivity. Sea trials were conducted with a commercial trawler in the Skagerak area. Three codend types were tested: (1) a standard codend with 104 mm meshes; (2) a standard 104 mm codend with two 85 mm square-mesh side windows; (3) a standard 104 mm codend with an 85-mm square-mesh top window. The twin-trawl method was used where one side of the rig had a 35-mm (nominal mesh size) control codend. Hauls of each codend were fitted simultaneously in a fixed- and random-effects model. In total, 24 and 30 hauls of haddock and cod, respectively, were included in the final selectivity analysis. This indicated that insertion of a top window in a standard codend improved the selectivity resulting in a lower selectivity ratio (SR/L50) and a higher L50 for cod and haddock, whereas insertion of side windows gave a lower selectivity ratio for both species, but a higher L50 for cod only. The results suggest that the recent mesh size increase to 120 mm in a standard codend is not sufficient to reduce the probability of discards to a negligible level with the existing minimum landing sizes. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The conclusion is that there have been problems at each level, with the ultimate effect that the policy has not been able to restrict fishing mortality and that the level of overexploitation has only increased. It is argued that the present TAC system has created more problems than it has resolved.

Here we review the successes and problems encountered with implementation of the WFD over the past 10 years and provide recommendations to further improve the implementation process. We particularly address three fields: (i) the development of assessment methods (including reference conditions, typologies and intercalibration); (ii) the implementation of assessment systems in monitoring programmes; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the design, monitoring and success of restoration measures).  The development of assessment methods has been a transparent process and has resulted in improved and more standardised tools for assessing water bodies across Europe. The process has been more time consuming, and methods are more complex, than originally expected. Future challenges still remain, including the estimation of uncertainty of assessment results and a revision of rules in combining the results obtained with different Biological Quality Elements.  A huge amount of monitoring data is now being generated for WFD purposes. Monitoring data are not centrally stored and thus poorly accessible for purposes beyond the WFD. Future challenges include enhanced data accessibility and the establishment of a Europe-wide central monitoring network of reference sites.  The WFD river basin management plans base management decisions on the response of aquatic organisms to environmental stress. In contrast to the effects of degradation, the biotic response to restoration is less well-known and poorly predictable. The timescale of the WFD (obtaining good ecological status in all surface waters by 2027) is over-ambitious. Future challenges include long-term monitoring of restoration measures to understand the requirements for ecosystems to recover and prioritisation of measures according to re-colonisation potential.},

We used selection models to estimate selection parameters by species and confidence bands to compare the selective properties of different gear types. For cod, haddock, hake, Nephrops, plaice, and whiting we obtained estimates for all three gear variants, whereas we obtained estimates for lemon sole and witch only with the standard and the SMP codends and for saithe only for the SMP codend. The SMP significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) improved selectivity of haddock in terms of releasing more individuals below minimum landing size (MLS). For a narrow size range of plaice below MLS, the SMP retained more individuals than did the standard codend. No effect of the SMP was detected for any of the other species. The grid codend significantly reduced catches of all fish species above MLS, but the codend also had an increased retention of cod and haddock below MLS. Furthermore, the grid resulted in a 17{\%} loss of marketable Nephrops. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The reproductive biology of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius, Linnaeus, 1758) was studied on the eastern central Atlantic Moroccan coast from November 2001 to December 2003. The sex ratio was close to 1:1 for the specimens with a total length of less than 45 cm. European hake spawned all year round, though two spawning peaks were recorded with a certain interannual variability: the first and main peak in winter and a secondary intermittent peak in summer. Length at first maturity was estimated as 28.6 cm and 33.8 cm total length for males and females, respectively. These values are closer to Mediterranean than Atlantic hake values. The mean batch fecundity was 299872 eggs ind1. The relative batch fecundity was estimated as 228 eggs per gram of gutted weight. Batch fecundity increased proportionally with fish length and weight. The batch fecundity of European hake in the Moroccan Atlantic area is higher than that in northern Atlantic and northwestern Mediterranean areas.},

abstract = {In the flatfish beam trawl fisheries the by-catch by weight of invertebrates is several times the amount of marketable fish. In order to reduce the impact of beam trawling on the benthic communities, a number of benthos escape modifications to the trawl were tested. A drop-out opening (escape zone without netting) and large diamond and square mesh escape zones just behind the groundrope were not effective in releasing the benthos by-catch and induced an unacceptable decrease in commercial catch. Square mesh windows inserted in the belly just in front of the cod-end were more promising. With these devices a significant reduction in weight and number of most benthic species could be realised. The penalty is some loss of commercial catch but the results indicate that with an appropriate mesh size in the square mesh window, a balance may be found between a significant benthos by-catch reduction and an acceptable loss of marketable fish. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A lightweight sorting grid was developed to reduce bycatch in the Danish small-meshed trawl fishery (22 mm full mesh in the cod end) for Norway pout in the North Sea. Experimental fishing with the grid demonstrated the possibility to capture Norway pout with only a minimum of unintended bycatch. Fishing with two different grid orientations, backwards and forwards-leaning, in distinct day and night hauls, resulted in an estimated release of between 88.4 and 100{\%} of the total number of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) entering the trawl. However, bycatch reductions were not significantly different between day and night or between grid orientations, indicating that the grid rejection of haddock and whiting is not influenced by fish behaviour. The loss of the target species, Norway pout, was low(between 5.6{\%} and 13.7{\%}) in comparison with the bycatch excluded, and clearly length dependent. Consequently, loss of target species would vary with the size structure of the population fished. Although results were not statistically significant, length-based analyses indicated that the grid rejection likelihood for particularly smaller Norway pout ({\textless}16 cm) was higher when fishing with the forwards-leaning grid during the night; this might be explained by behavioural and visual aspects of the fish-grid encounter process for Norway pout.},

Primarily, concerns arise from the perception that prawn trawls catch and discard large numbers of juveniles of species that, when larger, are targeted in other commercial and recreational fisheries. While several management options are available, the majority of fisheries in the world have attempted to address this issue through physical modifications to trawls, designed to improve selectivity. The types of modifications used reflect fishery-specific characteristics; however, most can be broadly classified into two categories, including: (1) those that separate species by differences in behaviour; and (2) those that mechanically exclude unwanted organisms according to their size. In the present paper, I provide a chronological review of publications in the primary literature that describe experiments examining modifications within these categories. This review shows that inherent variabilities among different fisheries greatly influence the types of designs that need to be applied and although some designs have the potential for application across different fisheries, significant modification and re-evaluation are often required. By collating information from previous studies, I also propose a framework encompassing the various stages involved in developing and applying successful modifications in prawn-trawl fisheries. The key stages identified include: (1) quantification of bycatches and accumulation of fishery-related information; (2) examination and re-evaluation of modifications; (3) assessment of damage inflicted on escaping individuals; and (4) promotion of recommended designs.},

abstract = {The effects of an increase in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of mesh configuration from 55 mm diamond to 55 mm square mesh on the size selectivity of four by-catch species (the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus and the blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou) commonly captured in the crustacean fishery off the Portuguese south coast, were evaluated. Selectivity parameters for blue whiting, the most abundant species in the catches, were estimated taking into account between-haul variation, while for the remaining species, captured in much lower quantities, the selectivity estimates were based on pooled data by length class for all hauls within the same cod end. Length at 50{\%} retention, L50, was found to increase with mesh size and with the change in mesh configuration for all the studied species. For blue whiting trawling depth and cod end catch were found to play a role in between-haul variation by increasing L50 as well. The results suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55-70 mm would be advisable to be compatible with the minimum landing sizes (MLSs) of 29 mm carapace length and 27 cm total length for red shrimp and hake, respectively, while it would greatly reduce the amount of discards, particularly those for blue whiting, that accounted for approximately 50{\%} of the total catch weight. Horse mackerel was the only species for which the use of a larger mesh size would result in a significant escapement of individuals above the MLS of 15 cm. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Despite increases in the minimum allowable mesh size in the Irish Sea Nephrops fishery the data presented here indicate that a large number of juvenile whiting are still being caught and discarded dead at sea. Preliminary flume tank studies were performed jointly with the Sea Fish Industry Authority (SFIA) in Hull. Observations indicated that the meshes in a panel of netting with square-shaped meshes inserted into the top of a trawl net remained open when the net was under tension, whereas the traditional diamond-shaped meshes tended to close. Trials at sea using the SOAFD (Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department) remote-controlled television vehicle (RCTV) confirmed that under tension the diamond-shaped meshes towards the end of the net closed during trawling whereas the square-shaped meshes of a panel inserted in this region remained open. Good escapement of small fish through the square mesh panel was filmed during trawling. Nephrops tended to scuttle along the bottom of the net and did not escape. Commercial fishing trials using a vessel rigged to pull two trawl nets simultaneously, one with a square mesh panel and one without, demonstrated significantly better whiting escapement from the net with the square panel than from the conventional all-diamond net. Results obtained from this investigation suggest that a panel of square-shaped mesh fitted to a Nephrops trawl could be an important whiting conservation tool. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {Several fleets with various fishing strategies operate as a mixed fishery in the Bay of Biscay. Among the main fleets, bottom trawlers target Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and, together with gillnetters, they also catch hake (Merluccius merluccius). Trawling leads to average-size catches that are below the minimum landing size (MLS); such catches are discarded since they cannot be sold. These discards result in negative impacts on stock renewal, as most of them do not survive. This also results in an economic loss for both bottom trawlers and gillnetters since these discards represent a future loss of rent. This study, based on the 2009 and 2010 selectivity experiments at sea, assesses the short- and long-term bio-economic impacts of four experimental selective devices aimed at reducing N. norvegicus and M. merluccius discards over a 20-year simulation period. Tests were conducted at sea on a research trawler. Using the impact assessment model for fisheries management (IAM model), selectivity scenarios for trawlers in the Bay of Biscay were compared to a theoretical selective scenario of adopting an optimal device that catches only N. norvegicus and M. merluccius above MLS (9 cm and 27 cm total length, respectively). Costs and benefits were analyzed with the objective of finding the best compromise between a reduction in discards of undersized fish and a loss of valuable catches among the experimental devices. Selectivity scenarios show positive impacts on stocks but different economic impacts between fleets. The combination of a square mesh cylinder with a grid and square mesh panels gives the closest results to the theoretical scenario tested in terms of stock recovery and economic benefits. This experimental device leads to low economic losses in the short term and eventually to higher N. norvegicus yields, which would be favourable for fleets that greatly contribute to N. norvegicus fishing efforts.},

abstract = {The genus Perkinsus includes protistan parasites infecting marine molluscs throughout the world, some of which are associated with mass mortalities. Life cycle involves vegetative proliferation within the host, by which a cell named trophozoite undergoes successive bipartitioning. Other stages have been observed in vitro or in vivo, depending on the species: hypnospore, zoosporangium and zoospore. Molecular taxonomy supports a close affinity between dinoflagellates and Perkinsus spp. Six species of Perkinsus are currently considered valid: P. marinus, P. olseni, P. qugwadi, P. chesapeaki, P. andrewsi and P. mediterraneus. Histology and, above all, incubation of host tissues in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) are classic diagnostic methods. In addition, more sensitive and quicker molecular diagnostic techniques based on either immunoassays or PCR have been developed for Perkinsus spp. Epizootiological studies have shown a marked influence of water temperature and salinity on P. marinus infection in oysters Crassostrea virginica, thus determining parasite geographical range and temporal disease dynamics (seasonality). In vitro cultures have been established for four Perkinsus spp. Immune response to infection varies depending on host and involves phagocytosis or encapsulation of the parasite cells by host haemocytes. A polypeptide is secreted by clam Tapes philippinarum haemocytes that could kill the parasite. In vitro cultured P. marinus cells secrete proteases that are likely involved in degradation of host tissues. P. marinus can suppress the toxic oxygen radicals produced by host haemocytes. In addition to host death, sublethal effects caused by Perkinsus spp. (reduction of fecundity, growth, and condition) may have significant ecological and economic implications. Various strategies have been assayed to mitigate the consequences of P. marinus epizootics on the oyster industry: modifications of management/culture procedures, selective breeding to obtain resistant oyster strains, and the use of triploid oysters and allochthonous oyster species. Some chemotherapeutants have been proved to inhibit or kill parasite cells in vitro.},

The scientists involved require a very particular set of skills, acquired over their career, drawing from biology, ecology, statistics, mathematical modelling, oceanography, fishery policy, and computing. There is a particular focus on producing a single "best" stock assessment model, but as fishery science advances, there are clear needs to address a range of hypotheses and uncertainties, from large-scale issues such as climate change to specific ones, such as high observation error on young hake. Key to our discussion is the use of the assessment for all frameworks to translate hypotheses into models. We propose a change to the current stock assessment procedure, driven by the use of model averaging to address a range of plausible hypotheses, where increased collaboration between the varied disciplines within fishery science will result in more robust advice.},

Fisheries management in the EU, Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand has developed following different paths, despite being based on similar instruments and principles. Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand have been at the forefront of developing management practices such as stakeholder involvement, legally binding management targets (Australia, New Zealand), individual transferable quotas, and discard bans (Iceland, New Zealand). The EU has since the beginning of the 21st century taken significant steps to better involve stakeholders and establish quantitative targets through management plans, and a landing obligation is gradually being implemented from 2015 onward. The management of domestic fisheries resources in Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland has, overall, performed better than in the EU, in terms of conservation and economic efficiency. It should, however, be stressed that, compared to Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland, (i) initial over-capacity was more of an issue in the EU when management measures became legally binding and also that (ii) EU has been progressive in developing common enforcement standards, on stocks shared by sovereign nations. The situation of EU fisheries has substantially improved over the period 2004–2013 in the northeast Atlantic, with fishery status getting close to that in the other jurisdictions, but the lack of recovery for Mediterranean fish stocks remains a concern.},

abstract = {Understanding and modelling fleet dynamics and their response to spatial constraints is a prerequisite to anticipating the performance of marine ecosystem management plans. A major challenge for fisheries managers is to be able to anticipate how fishing effort is re-allocated following any permanent or seasonal closure of fishing grounds, given the competition for space with other active maritime sectors. In this study, a Random Utility Model (RUM) was applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the French demersal mixed fleet fishing in the Eastern English Channel. The explanatory variables chosen were past effort i.e. experience or habit, previous catch to represent previous success, {\%} of area occupied by spatial regulation, and by other competing maritime sectors. Results showed that fishers tended to adhere to past annual fishing practices, except the fleet targeting molluscs which exhibited within year behaviour influenced by seasonality. Furthermore, results indicated French and English scallop fishers share the same fishing grounds, and maritime traffic may impact on fishing decision. Finally, the model was validated by comparing predicted re-allocation of effort against observed effort, for which there was a close correlation.},

abstract = {This study presents a fleet-based bioeconomic simulation model to the international mixed flatfish fishery in the North Sea. The model uses a Management Strategies Evaluation framework including a discrete choice model accounting for short-term temporal changes in effort allocation across fisheries. A simplified random utility model was used based on the expected revenue (or economic attractiveness) and two tradition parameters related to short and long term historical fishing patterns. All three parameters were significant. Even though reactions and adaptations vary between fleets, the estimated conservative behaviour of the main fleets led to only marginal effect at the stock level. The importance of accounting for fleet behaviour was then evaluated using an elasticity analysis to explore how increased weight of economic attractiveness contributes to changes in the biological output and positive increase in the economic performance of the individual fleets. This showed the existence of a window of sensitivity of the model to the behaviour assumptions. The study highlights the challenge of implementing an effort allocation model in a general framework of Management Strategies Evaluation for mixed-fisheries, and illustrates the necessary trade-offs between very detailed numerical relationships and the representation of aggregated processes. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Relatively little scientific work has been done to assess the selectivity of square-mesh codends in the highly variable multi-species conditions in the Italian trawl fisheries. Therefore this study was initiated to investigate the effect of using square-mesh and larger diamond-mesh codends on size selectivity of deepwater red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea) and red mullet (Mullus barbatus), with possible implication in future management measures. Four different codends were used in the sea trials. When size selection estimates are applied for management issues it is not sufficient only to consider the mean size selection parameters. It also needs to consider the effect of between-haul variations in the selection process. In the current study, potential consequences of the between-haul variation on the selection curves have been considered by applying a pooled curve with a double bootstrap approach. The results attained in the present study indicate that the use of 40. mm square-mesh codend results in a 50{\%} retention length (L50) similar to that of the 50. mm diamond-mesh codend, but with a steeper selection range (SR). For red mullet, both 50. mm diamond-mesh and 40. mm square-mesh codends lead to an L50 that is higher than the minimum landing size (MLS, 11. cm). Deepwater red shrimp is not subject to any MLS and may always be landed legally. However, large amounts of juveniles of deepwater red shrimp have been retained in all codends. Council Regulation (EC) No. 1967/2006 called for a discard reduction policy in waters under the jurisdiction of the European Union. As demonstrated in the current paper, to simultaneously improve the size selectivity of fish and shrimp species can be difficult due to large differences in their morphological characteristics, therefore it may question whether more sophisticated alternative of selective devices, such as grids or square-mesh panels, could be implemented in some Mediterranean fisheries. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The North Sea beam trawl fishery, which catches large amounts of undersized plaice, is used as a model system. Under a discard ban, fishing is restricted to the fishing grounds and weeks where the maximum revenue can be realised with other species while catching the quota of the restricted species with a reduced bycatch of undersized fish. Model results suggest that, if properly enforced, a discard ban provides an incentive to implement more selective fishing gears that catch fewer small fish and are more fuel efficient (pulse trawl). If a discard ban is not properly enforced, restrictive quota do not necessarily result in the intended decrease in discarding as the fishery continues to fish while discarding the over-quota catch and least valuable size classes caught.},

abstract = {A conditional maximum likelihood model is used to estimate the size-selectivity of trawls, gillnets, and hooks when the data are obtained by simultaneous fishing with meshes or hooks of different size and/or shape. Size-selectivity is expressed here by the selection curve, r(l), the probability that a fish of length 1, if contacting the gear, will be retained (caught). In many selectivity studies r(l) is fitted either by eye, by heuristic means, or by improper application of generalized linear models. Then it is not possible to make legitimate statistical inference about r(l), or about assessments of the state of the fishery if those assessments use r(l). It is shown here that by conditioning on the total catch, selectivity data can be modeled as binary data, or polytomous data on interval scales. Application of the model to trawl and hook data demonstrates that selection curves can be fitted using generalized linear models, which may require nonstandard link functions or link functions with parameter},

abstract = {Five modified trawl codends were assessed for their utility in simultaneously improving the size selectivity of cod (Gadus morhua) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the Baltic Sea. The modifications included refining the selective performance of the current Bacoma codend by increasing the mesh size of the lower panel from 109. mm double twine to 129. mm single twine and increasing the mesh size in the upper square mesh panel from 132 to 147. mm, and also making the lower panel the same design as the upper panel; i.e. a full square mesh codend. These three experimental designs were tested in conjunction with the currently legislated codends; Bacoma and T90. The most favourable selective properties with regard to simultaneously improving the selectivity for round and flatfish, considering the current minimum landing sizes (MLS) for cod (38. cm) and plaice (25. cm) in the Baltic Sea and the fish population size structures during the sea trials, were found to be the T90 codend and the Bacoma codend with a modified lower panel. For the T90 codend, the selection parameters (L50 and SR) were 43.4 and 6.7. cm for cod, and 24.7 and 2.1. cm for plaice.

The narrow codend has better selectivity than the standard codend (L-50 = 14.28 cm for hake and 14.11 cm for poor cod). The selectivity of the square mesh top panel codend was higher than that of the narrow codend for hake (L-50 = 15.25 cm), while it was similar for poor cod (L-50 = 14.25 cm)},

abstract = {The utility of oblique separator panels combined with square mesh windows for reducing by-catch (mainly boarfish (Capros aper), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus)) was examined in the Algarve crustacean trawl fishery.Three different panel/window mesh size combinations and the window alone were tested. The results suggest that the amount of blue whiting excluded was independent of the use of the separator panel, as well as the mesh sizes of the panel and the square mesh window. Between 67 and 71{\%} of the total catch of this species was excluded. The window mesh size however, significantly affected the escape of boarfish, with the average escape percentage released rising from 10 to 44{\%} as the mesh size increased from 70 to 100 mm.The highest exclusion rates were obtained with the use of a 120 mm separator panel together with a 100 mm square mesh window. Under these conditions, the exclusion of by-catch was maximised while maintaining the catch for the target species(rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, and Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus). In hauls where the square mesh window was used alone, only the escape rate of blue whiting was significant (67{\%}), while boarfish escaped in much lower proportions and shrimp above the minimum landing size were lost. Despite the efficiency of these panels as by-catch excluders, their complex design is a major drawback to commercial adoption. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many commercial fish stocks are beginning to recover under more sustainable exploitation regimes. In this study, we document the temporal and spatial changes in one remarkable example of stock recovery: northern European hake (Merluccius merluccius). Analysing data from several scientific surveys, we document a dramatic increase in estimates of biomass between 2004 and 2011 throughout the larger area now occupied by the stock. The largest increase occurred in the North Sea, where hake have been largely absent for over 50 years. Spatio-temporally resolved commercial landings show that high densities occur in the North Sea only between April and September, suggesting a density-dependent seasonal habitat expansion to suitable temperature and depth conditions. These changes have implications for the management of the stock which are discussed. Notably, if discards are banned as part of management revisions, the relatively low quota for hake in the North Sea will be a limiting factor (the so-called ‘choke' species) which may result in a premature closure of the entire demersal mixed fishery in the North Sea, jeopardiz- ing many commercial fisheries in the region. This example of the unforeseen conse- quences of improved stewardship highlight the need for a more holistic, regional and responsive approach to managing our marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Based on size selectivity data for more than 25 000 cod (Gadus morhua) collected during experimental trawl fishing with six different codends, all of which included a square mesh panel, we investigated the effect on cod-release efficiency based on the size of the square mesh panel area, position of the square mesh panel, and stimulation of the escape response. Based on the results, we were able to explain why the BACOMA codend, applied in the Baltic Sea cod directed trawl fishery, releases juvenile cod efficiently, whereas other designs, including a square mesh panel with similar mesh size, are less efficient. Our main findings reveal that the release efficiency of the square mesh panel in the BACOMA codend depends largely on the overlap of the square mesh panel and the catch-accumulation zone in the codend, where cod do not have the option of just drifting further back in the trawl when proximate to the panel. On the contrary, the reduction in panel size by 50{\%} did not significantly affect the release efficiency when the panel overlapped with the catch-accumulation zone. It was possible to stimulate an escape response for cod to achieve a release through a square mesh panel positioned away from the catch-accumulation zone. Our findings demonstrated that this release was as efficient as for a panel mounted in the catch-accumulation zone of the codend. Devices that stimulate behaviour may improve the release efficiency of cod through square mesh panels in other fisheries where this is a problem.},

abstract = {A great deal of progress has recently been made in reducing bycatch and discards through improving the selectivity of fishing gear. Selective fishing has a large potential to reduce fish mortality among non-target species and juveniles, but it can be justified only if significant numbers of escaping fish survive. This study aims to assess and summarize the principal factors affecting the stress, injury and mortality of fish that arise from fishing processes, particularly when fish escape from trawl gears. Potential sources of error in the assessment of survival are identified, and improved methodological approaches and practices are suggested. Furthermore, the study attempts to evaluate the key principles for designing fishing gears and operations that reduce or eliminate the mortality of escapees. Finally, it assesses the problems associated with estimating the impacts of unaccounted fish mortality. Studies on the mortality of fish discarded from the decks of fishing vessels generally show high mortality rates, although the types of injuries and their severity are highly species-specific. Most fish with gas bladders that inflate after capture die because of pressure changes. The post-release mortality of other fish and aquatic organisms (i.e. those without gas bladders) is more variable and may sometimes be low. Mortality is also related to the overall fragility and physical characteristics of species. For some species, discard mortalities can be reduced through reduced exposure to air and improved ondeck handling procedures, but in many cases a significant reduction of discard mortality is difficult to achieve. Efforts should therefore be directed towards maximizing the escape of fish during fishing. This would significantly increase the likelihood of their survival. Most scientific work on escape survival applies to towed gears, in particular trawl gears. In general, relatively high survival has been observed for many species, particularly gadoids and flatfishes, which escape from trawl codends. Substantially lower survival rates have been recorded for some pelagic species, but few studies have adequately explained the full range of stress, injury and mortality that can occur when fish escape from trawl codends under commercial fishing conditions. Moreover, survival estimates may have been affected by inferior methods of collecting, transporting and monitoring the escapees. Biases may have been significant, particularly among the smallest escapees, which are most sensitive to all kinds of handling. Substantial improvements in methodologies for assessing escape mortality rates across a wider range of fisheries and environmental conditions are suggested. There are various options available to improve the survival of escapees. First, fish that escape from a fishing gear should do so quickly and, in the case of towed gears, should not enter into the aft part of the codend, where the risk of serious injury is greatest. Installing escape panels or other sorting devices at strategic positions in a fishing gear can enhance escape and the survival of juveniles and non-target species. Furthermore, facilitating the voluntary escape of fish through various constructional and operational solutions would increase the likelihood of their survival. The use of non-abrasive netting materials, the exclusion of debris and large objects from codends, and better design, operations and rigging of nets could improve survival. In some cases, use of other fishing methods or avoidance of areas with high densities of juveniles, non-target species and predators may be an appropriate approach to reducing unaccounted mortality associated with escape. Improved selection means that a larger part of the fish population will escape from a fishing gear. If the survival rates of these fish are low, there may be no advantages associated with changing selectivity. In the worst case, the effect of this type of unaccounted mortality on fish stocks may be negative because overall fish mortality is underestimated. Moreover, the benefits of the change of selectivity may be largely overestimated. For many important fish species there are insufficient estimates of escape survival to conduct an assessment of the impacts on stocks and fisheries. Failure to quantify the biological impacts of this largely unknown mortality could result in biases in stock assessments and management failures.},

Improved understanding of the principles of the selection of fish by gears has now changed the list of parameters which are known to have a significant effect upon selection and need to be measured at sea.

Some lost traps are functional for a long period of time, even in shallow waters. Consequences for gillnets after loss depend on seabed conditions. The ghost fishing function of gillnets remaining on flat seabeds declines rapidly with decreasing heights and increasing visibility. Gillnets left tangled around an artificial reef, for example, three-dimensionally maintain the initial magnitude of ghost fishing for a long period of time, even after badly fouled. There are increasing numbers of researches working on the total number of mortality per gear after gear loss for gillnets and trammel-nets. It has become also possible to estimate the total number of mortality for a unit period of time in a certain fishing sector.

abstract = {This paper describes a theory and method for determining a grid selectivity curve from the data of a Fishing experiment using a grid separator with several bar spacings. Grid selectivity is defined as the probability that a fish does not pass through a grid given that it has encountered the grid. Assuming that grid selectivity is regarded as a sieve process, grid selectivity, s(g), can be expressed as a function of the ratio of cross-sectional diameter to bar spacing as follows: s(g)(d,L) = S(g)(R), where L and d are the cross-sectional diameter of the fish body and bar spacing of the grid, respectively, and R = L/d. Application of the model is demonstrated by a fishing experiment using three grids with bar spacings of 8, 10 and 15 mm, carried out in a shrimp beam trawl in the Inland Sea of Japan. Grid selectivity was plotted against length by bar spacing, of two shrimp species (southern rough shrimp Trachypenaeus curvirostris and mantis shrimp Oratosquilla oratoria), two crab species (charybdid crab Charybdis bimaculata and portunid crab Portunus hastatoides), and frog flounder Pleuronichthys cornutus. The selectivity analysis in terms of the non- dimensional parameter R revealed that, for each species, a single selectivity curve describes accurately data of each of the grids as a master curve of grid selectivity. The master curve of grid selectivity allows estimation of the selectivity curve of grids other than those tested in this experiment.},

Two positions were assessed with an 80 mm panel, one at the start of the extension and one in the codend. These were compared with the selectivity of a codend with no panel fitted. Results demonstrated that the 80 mm panel in the forward position showed no significant difference when compared to the standard codend. The 80 mm panel inserted in the codend significantly improved the selectivity of the gear. A 100 mm panel inserted in the codend was also tested during five hauls, but had no statistically significant effect due to insufficient fish being retained by this combination.

abstract = {In demersal trawling, there is a need to develop more species-selective trawls to minimize discarding in multispecies fisheries. This requires observational tools that can operate at depths and light levels encountered by the commercial fleets. There is a growing tendency towards more fishery-independent stock-assessment methods using survey trawls to provide population indices. This requires the ability to quantify the herding and capture efficiency by species and age groups of such gears. A range of optical and acoustic observation techniques has been developed over the past few decades to assist in these goals. In this paper we update the review of technologies presented at the ICES Symposium on Fish Behaviour in Relation to Fishing Operations held in 1992. Since then, considerable advances in optical, acoustic, and data-processing technology have been made.

abstract = {Abstract More than 50{\%} of the world's total marine catch (approximately 81 million tonnes) is harvested using towed fishing gears (i.e. Danish seines, dredges and otter and beam trawls). As for all methods, the total fishing mortality of these gears comprises the reported (landed) and unreported catch and other unaccounted, collateral deaths due to (i) avoiding, (ii) escaping, (iii) dropping out of the gear during fishing, (iv) discarding from the vessel, (v) ghost fishing of lost gear, (vi) habitat destruction or subsequent (vii) predation and (viii) infection from any of the above. The inherent poor selectivity of many towed gears, combined with their broad spatial deployment, means that there is considerable potential for cumulative effects of (i)-(viii) listed above on total fishing mortality, and subsequent wide-scale negative impacts on stocks of important species. In this paper, we develop a strategy for minimizing this unwanted exploitation by reviewing all the primary literature studies that have estimated collateral, unaccounted fishing mortalities and identifying the key causal factors. We located more than 80 relevant published studies (between 1890 and early 2006) that quantified the mortalities of more than 120 species of escaping (26 papers) or discarded (62 papers) bivalves, cephalopods, crustaceans, echinoderms, elasmobranches, reptiles, teleosts and miscellaneous organisms. Seven of these studies also included the estimates of mortalities caused by dropping out of gears, predation and infection (iii), (vii) and (viii) listed above. Owing to several key biological (physiology, size and catch volume and composition), environmental (temperature, hypoxia, sea state and availability of light) and technical (gear design, tow duration and speed) factors, catch-and-escape or catch-and-discarding mechanisms were identified to evoke cumulative negative effects on the health of most organisms. We propose that because the mortalities of discards typically are much greater than escapees, the primary focus of efforts to mitigate unaccounted fishing mortalities should concentrate on the rapid, passive, size and species selection of non-target organisms from the anterior sections of towed gears during fishing. Once maximum selection has been achieved and demonstrated to cause few mortalities, efforts should be made to modify other operational and/or post-capture handling procedures that address the key causal factors listed above.},

Consequently the management and understanding of the exploitation pattern of the stock is of major importance. Technical regulations, improving the selectivity of cod, have been a major management strategy and the Baltic Sea is likely to be the area where most fishing gear selectivity studies, focussing on size selectivity, have been conducted over time. The methodology for conducting and analysing selectivity data has been significantly improved in recent years. The subject is reviewed since the choice of methodology can have a significant effect on the interpretation of the outcome of selectivity experiments. Factors affecting the selectivity of trawl and gill nets are considered. Alternative ways to improve the size and species selectivity of trawls using selective devices are reviewed. Selectivity parameters from available literature are listed and the correlations of selectivity parameters to the mesh size for different gears are estimated. The historical legislation on selectivity is reviewed and the expected selectivity for trawls is estimated. Management considerations concerning the mortality of escaping and discarded fish and wider management impacts have to be considered if improving selectivity. The review is ended by conclusions including reflections on needed research in the future.},

Under laboratory conditions, undersized adolescent male snow crab ( 94 mm carapace width) were capable of detecting, approaching, and interacting with escape mechanisms, and the location of the mechanisms was important in determining the likelihood of escape success. Escape mechanisms mounted low on the exterior wall of the trap received more than three times the number of penetration attempts than those mounted higher, although successful escape rates were very low. There was no difference in behaviour or escape success between traditional mesh traps and experimental wire (Aquameshw) traps fitted with escape mechanisms.

abstract = {The selectivity for Nephrops (Nephrops norvegicus) in trawl codends generally is poor and the lack of steepness of the selection curve results in high discard rates and/or loss of legal-sized catch. This poor codend selectivity often is attributed to the irregular shape of Nephrops, which to some extent characterizes the problem as insoluble. In the present study, the FISHSELECT methodology was used to examine the selection process of the species in order to identify ways to improve selectivity. The use of three different modes of orientation for contact (contact modes) with the codend meshes explained most of the characteristics of the selection curves for Nephrops obtained experimentally. The contact mode with the smallest cross-section was optimal for mesh penetration and, when evaluated against experimental data, 87.5{\%} of all Nephrops encountering the gear were estimated to meet the netting in this contact mode. The range of configurations of the meshes (e.g., opening angles in the diamond mesh netting) was determinative for the selectivity, and the selective process for Nephrops was found to take place along the entire length of the codend. Simulating selectivity in a diamond mesh codend in which the closed meshes in the forward part of the codend were replaced by more open meshes revealed that the selectivity for Nephrops can be efficiently improved. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The spawning-stock biomass of cod (Gadus morhua) in the Kattegat area is at a historically low level. Throughout the past decade considerable efforts have been devoted to research on improving both species and size selectivity of the trawls used in the mixed demersal fishery in the area, because this provides a valuable management tool for reducing the bycatch of cod and reducing mortality, and thus helping to rebuild the depleted stock. Gear research in the area has been focused on devices that allow for continued exploitation of the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and flatfish, but minimizing the bycatch. We review the results of previous and continuing experiments with various codend mesh sizes, mesh configurations, escape windows, sorting grids, sorting frames, and separator panels, but also changes in whole-trawl designs. Based on our review, we compare and discuss the gear-related technical measures and their effectiveness in maintaining a commercial fishery on viable stocks, yet protecting cod. We discuss the results in relation to changes in legislation and experience with implementation of new selective devices in recent years.

abstract = {According to a recent World Bank report, the intensification of global fishing effort and the ensuing depletion of marine fish stocks causes economic losses of 50. billion US dollars annually. Data deficiencies, however, currently hamper analysis of global fishing effort. We analyzed data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the EUROPA fishing fleet registry, and peer-reviewed and other publications, to determine the global trends in fishing effort from 1950 to 2006. Our results show that global fishing effort, expressed as total engine power and the number of fishing days in a year (kilowatt. days), was roughly constant from 1950 to 1970, and then steadily increased up to the present. Europe dominated global fishing effort, followed by Asia. Projecting current trends suggests that Asia will soon surpass Europe. Trawlers contribute a major fraction of global fishing effort, as do vessels greater than 100 gross registered tons. Current estimates of global fishing effort, the number of vessels, and total vessel tonnage are, however, underestimates given the data gaps that we have identified. Our results are useful in the following ways: (1) they may encourage researchers in academia and government to improve global fishing effort databases; (2) they allow deeper global analyses of the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems; (3) they induce caution in accepting current underestimates of economic losses of global fisheries; and (4) they reinforce calls for a reduction in global fishing effort. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Danish Nephrops directed fishery is conducted with trawl and by-catch of roundfish as well as flatfish constitute an important part of the revenue. The trawls are therefore designed to retain both the relatively small Nephrops and the larger fish. Consequently, the gear also retains large amounts of fish and Nephrops below the minimum landing size. The fraction of the catch that for one reason or another is not landed will be thrown over board {\^{a}}“ this is referred to as discard. The majority of the discard will die and it therefore poses an economical, ecological and political problem. The present Ph.D. thesis consists of a review and 4 papers, describing the problem and proposing technological measures that reduce discards. The study on which Paper I is based was an investigation of the selective properties of the fishing gears used in the fishery. The gears had been investigated previously but selection parameters that are used for comparing the length-based retention still needed to be estimated for several species. The investigation documented that the relatively high discard rates found in this fishery primarily resulted from mis-matches in regulations on minimum landing size and mesh sizes. The mechanisms determining the size selection of fish are well documented but due to the irregular morphology of Nephrops and their poor swimming capacity, the selection of this species has been regarded as being less predictable and therefore non-controllable. Paper II presents the results from an extensive study of Nephrops measuring the morphology that influence whether they will pass through a mesh or not. Subsequent simulations demonstrated that the selection process is predictable and that variation in mesh configuration to a high degree determine the effectiveness of size selectivity of a gear for this species. Another important result was a clear indication of Nephrops escaping through meshes along the entire length of the codend. This is in contrast to the escape of fish that primarily happen in the rearmost part of the codend. In the majority of trawl fisheries, the meshes in the codend are diamond shaped and as the catch accumulates, the increased drag will close the meshes. This will not happen in square meshes. Consequently, these meshes are often found to have better selective properties for a range of species including Nephrops and round fish (e.g. cod) whereas some species of flatfish escape more easily through diamond meshes. If the size selectivity of different species need to be considered in the same gear, a combination of different mesh types could therefore be an option. How to distribute the different mesh types optimally in the codend will depend upon the preferred direction of escape of the different species. Paper III presents a study where fish and Nephrops escaping through meshes in the upper and the lower panel were collected in different collecting bags. Based on knowledge attained in this and the previous investigations, a codend was constructed with the lower panel made of square meshes and the other panels made of diamond mesh netting. For cod and Nephrops, the selective properties obtained for this combined codend were as good as those obtained for a plain square mesh codend whereas the size selection of plaice resembled that of a diamond mesh codend. The results from this experiment are presented in Paper IV. The implementation of more selective fishing gears and management initiatives that focus on the catches instead of landings will contribute to the development of a more selective fishery. In the following review, a range of technological measures that can improve selectivity in the Nephrops directed fishery is presented},

abstract = {We identified and quantified the effect of season, depth, and inner and outer panel mesh size on the trammel net catch species composition and catch rates in four southern European areas (Northeast Atlantic: Basque Country, Spain; Algarve, Portugal; Gulf of C??diz, Spain; Mediterranean: Cyclades, Greece), all of which are characterised by important trammel net fisheries. In each area, we conducted, in 1999-2000, seasonal, experimental fishing trials at various depths with trammel nets of six different inner/outer panel mesh combinations (i.e., two large outer panel meshes and three small inner panel meshes). Overall, our study covered some of the most commonly used inner panel mesh sizes, ranging from 40 to 140 mm (stretched). We analysed the species composition and catch rates of the different inner/outer panel combinations with regression, multivariate analysis (cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling) and other 'community' techniques (number of species, dominance curves). All our analyses indicated that the outer panel mesh sizes used in the present study did not significantly affect the catch characteristics in terms of number of species, catch rates and species composition. Multivariate analyses and seasonal dominance plots indicated that in Basque, Algarve and Cyclades waters, where sampling covered wide depth ranges, both season and depth strongly affected catch species compositions. For the Gulf of C??diz, where sampling was restricted to depths 10-30 m, season was the only factor affecting catch species composition and thus group formation. In contrast, the inner panel mesh size did not generally affect multidimensional group formation in all areas but affected the dominance of the species caught in the Algarve and the Gulf of C??diz. Multivariate analyses also revealed 11 different m??tiers (i.e., season-depth-species-inner panel mesh size combinations) in the four areas. This clearly indicated the existence of trammel net 'hot spots', which represent essential habitats (e.g., spawning, nursery or wintering grounds) of the life history of the targeted and associated species. The number of specimens caught declined significantly with inner panel mesh size in all areas. We attributed this to the exponential decline in abundance with size, both within- and between-species. In contrast, the number of species caught in each area was not related to the inner mesh size. This was unexpected and might be a consequence of the wide size-selective range of trammel nets. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The target product is a male crab with a carapace width of [{\~{}}]105 mm or greater. Selectivity was tested at two discrete depths (600 and 800 m), for four different escape ring scenarios: control trap with no escape rings, and escape rings with internal diameters of 9, 10, and 11 cm. Proportions of non-marketable C. quinquedens were large (71-100{\%}) at both depths for all traps, but were smallest in traps with escape rings. Discard mortality was estimated at [{\~{}}]5{\%} through caging experiments across three haul frequency conditions (every 24 h, every 4 d, and after 8 d), which represented the likely reality of multiple recaptures during a commercial trip. The impact of discarding techniques (low and high impact) was also assessed. If discard proportion estimates of {\textgreater}71{\%} are realistic, and if an estimated [{\~{}}]5{\%} of these discards die, the recommendation must be made for fishery participants to improve gear selectivity, and thereby to minimize discard mortality rates. On the management side, stock assessments will be more accurate if estimates of discard mortality are incorporated.},

Tiene adem{\'{a}}s como prop{\'{o}}sito complementar las Orientaciones T{\'{e}}cnicas de FAO para la Pesca Responsable N{\textordmasculine} 4: La ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera. Est{\'{a}} dirigida principalmente al administrador que practica la ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera y al {\'{o}}rgano de decisi{\'{o}}n, con {\'{e}}nfasis particular en los pa{\'{i}}ses en desarrollo, aunque se espera que tambi{\'{e}}n sea de inter{\'{e}}s para los administradores en pa{\'{i}}ses desarrollados. La ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera es una disciplina compleja y en evoluci{\'{o}}n, y todav{\'{i}}a se est{\'{a}} aprendiendo mucho sobre lo que implica, lo que funciona y lo que no. El problema es agravado por el hecho que la ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera, como disciplina coherente, no ha sido bien definida todav{\'{i}}a, y frecuentemente es tambi{\'{e}}n poco entendida. Esta publicaci{\'{o}}n intenta identificar las labores principales de la ordenaci{\'{o}}n de pesquer{\'{i}}as de captura, con {\'{e}}nfasis particular en la utilizaci{\'{o}}n sostenible de los recursos biol{\'{o}}gicos y en demostrar c{\'{o}}mo se deber{\'{i}}an llevar a cabo estas labores de manera integrada y coordinada para obtener los beneficios deseados de los recursos biol{\'{o}}gicos de forma sostenible y responsable. Esta Gu{\'{i}}a est{\'{a}} dividida en nueve cap{\'{i}}tulos, cada uno escrito por expertos en ese campo de diversas partes del mundo. El Cap{\'{i}}tulo 1 ofrece una introducci{\'{o}}n a la ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera y describe lo que es y qu{\'{e}} o qui{\'{e}}n es el administrador pesquero. Analiza las interrelaciones entre las metas y los objetivos y los planes, medidas y estrategias de ordenaci{\'{o}}n, adem{\'{a}}s de examinar algunos de los aspectos principales que deben ser considerados por los administradores en la ejecuci{\'{o}}n de sus tareas. El Cap{\'{i}}tulo 2 consiste en un an{\'{a}}lisis general de los diferentes tipos de artes de pesca y los impactos de cada uno sobre la especie objetivo, las especies de captura incidental y el resto del ecosistema, y discute c{\'{o}}mo la ordenaci{\'{o}}n puede regular el uso y las caracter{\'{i}}sticas de los artes de pesca. El Cap{\'{i}}tulo 3 examina el papel de las {\'{a}}reas y de las temporadas de veda dentro de la ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera, analizando las diversas metas que pueden lograr y sus ventajas y desventajas potenciales. Incluye varios estudios de caso que demuestran su uso en la pr{\'{a}}ctica. El Cap{\'{i}}tulo 4 examina el control de insumos directos (esfuerzo) y del producto (captura) en las pesquer{\'{i}}as, y explica los diferentes tipos de controles de insumos y productos, las estructuras y la capacidad necesaria para su aplicaci{\'{o}}n, as{\'{i}} como de los problemas m{\'{a}}s comunes que pueden surgir al usarlos. Se deben desarrollar todas estas medidas y estrategias de ordenaci{\'{o}}n para cumplir con los objetivos acordados para la pesquer{\'{i}}a, y el Cap{\'{i}}tulo 5 describe la forma en que el administrador pesquero puede determinar las estrategias m{\'{a}}s apropiadas para sus objetivos, con especial {\'{e}}nfasis en el rol y uso de la informaci{\'{o}}n cient{\'{i}}fica y de otra {\'{i}}ndole sobre la pesquer{\'{i}}a y el recurso que {\'{e}}sta explota. Hoy en d{\'{i}}a es generalmente aceptado que las pesquer{\'{i}}as de acceso abierto son biol{\'{o}}gica, econ{\'{o}}mica y socialmente perjudiciales, y el Cap{\'{i}}tulo 6 examina el tema de la asignaci{\'{o}}n de derechos de uso en las pesquer{\'{i}}as. Presenta la naturaleza y los tipos de derechos de uso, y la forma de instrumentarlos. Demuestra que los derechos de uso son tambi{\'{e}}n una forma de medida de ordenaci{\'{o}}n, y c{\'{o}}mo los diversos sistemas de derechos de uso ayudan a lograr los diferentes objetivos. En el Cap{\'{i}}tulo 7 prevalece el {\'{e}}nfasis en los grupos de usuarios y partes interesadas, y se considera la importancia de que estas partes participen como socios en la ordenaci{\'{o}}n pesquera. Presenta los alcances y escalas que pueden abarcar estas asociaciones, y examina los beneficios y los problemas de administrarlas, incluyendo las condiciones necesarias para que las asociaciones sean efectivas. Por {\'{u}}ltimo, el Cap{\'{i}}tulo 9 describe la importancia de formular planes de ordenaci{\'{o}}n para las pesquer{\'{i}}as, y lo que {\'{e}}stos deben incluir. Examina su aplicaci{\'{o}}n y la necesidad de revisar estos planes peri{\'{o}}dicamente.

During an experiment west of Bear Island in summer 2001, the total selectivity of a commercial cod trawl with a single grid mounted (grid selectivity× codend selectivity) was compared with that of the same trawl without a grid (codend selectivity). This is the first comparison of the selectivity of these gears during a single experiment. The results showed a surprisingly similar selection range for grid and codend selectivity: around 10 cm. With a grid mounted, the 50{\%} retention length of the trawl rose by about 4 cm.

abstract = {Herein we propose a method to assess dual selection in grid based selectivity systems. This method takes into account the parameter " grid contact likelihood" (Cgrid), which can be interpreted as the proportion of fish that actually makes an attempt to escape through the grid. In a case study of the Barents Sea cod and haddock trawl fishery, we demonstrate that our model describes the experimental data better than the models previously used to fit similar data. For both cod and haddock, Cgrid was significantly smaller than 1.0, which demonstrated the relevance of the proposed model. Cgrid was higher for haddock than for cod, which might be due to behavioral differences between the species. The Cgrid values for both species suggest that the grid functions well, as on average more than 75{\%} of the cod and more than 94{\%} of the haddock were predicted to able to attempt an escape through the device. For both species the contact L50 for the grid (L50grid) was significantly higher than the L50 for the codend (L50codend). These values agree with the experimental observations that most of the escaping fish use the grid to escape, whereas only a very few escape occurs through the codend. By parametric simulation and using the case study results as the baseline, we investigated and compared the precision of the selectivity parameters estimated with our model for two different experimental setups. The results show that except for some extreme situations, the data for such studies need to be collected with a three-compartment setup to avoid imprecise estimates of Cgrid, L50grid, SRgrid, L50codend, and SRcodend. In general, only the combined selectivity of the grid and the codend could be estimated with acceptable precision using a standard two-compartment sampling approach. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mediterranean demersal fisheries have experienced an ongoing decline in catches over the past 20 years as a result of excessive increases in effort caused both by growth in trawler engine power and by rapid technological advances in fish finding and fishing technology. This has led to an overexploitation of these resources. An increasing share of the catches consists of immature individuals. This study was undertaken to test a sorting grid with a bar spacing of 20 mm as a means of excluding juveniles in the commercial hake (Merluccius merluccius) fishery in the Catalan Sea, western Mediterranean. The grid was placed in the extension section of the gear 5 m in front of a cod-end. Divided cod-end design was used to collect the escapees and target species. The mean selection length (L-50) of the ten hauls was 14.2 +/- 0.7 cm SE. with a selection range of 7.3 cm +/- 0.4 SE. The biomass of hake under L-50 that escaped through the grid represented 50.1{\%} +/- 6.7 SE of the total hake biomass. These results are promising and indicate that a sorting grid can be used in excluding young hake. This was a first step toward implementation of sorting grids in commercial trawl gears as means of avoiding unwanted catches of small individuals in the hake fisheries in the Mediterranean Sea. Further trials are required to improve the sorting efficiency of the grid.},

abstract = {Two experiments, done in a south-eastern Australian trawl fishery targeting school whiting (Sillago flindersi: Sillaginidae), examined the relative efficiencies and selectivities of five codends and extension sections made from double-twine, 90-mm (inside stretched length) mesh netting. All extension sections were made from 3-mm diameter twine and were 100 meshes long and 100 meshes in circumference, while the codends were 25 meshes in length. The first experiment tested three codends made from 4-mm diameter twine: one with a circumference of 100 meshes and two of 200-mesh circumference, with one of the latter incorporating two cross-sectional joins in its extension piece. The second experiment compared two 200-mesh circumference codends, one constructed from 3-mm diameter twine and the other from 5-mm diameter twine. The codends were alternately fished with a small-meshed control. The results showed a general trend of reduced selection by the 200-mesh circumference and thicker twined codends, and especially by the industry-preferred 200-mesh circumference codend constructed from 5-mm diameter twine. Experiment 1 found that the 100-mesh codend caught significantly fewer school whiting, retained catch and total catch than did the two 200-mesh codends, and the 200-mesh codend with the modified extension section caught significantly fewer school whiting and retained catch than did the 200-mesh codend with the straight extension. In the second experiment, the 200-mesh 5-mm twine codend caught significantly more total and retained catch, school whiting, and longspine flathead (Platycephalus longispinis: Platycephalidae) than did the 200-mesh 3-mm twine codend. Across all codends, the smallest lengths at 50{\%} probability of retention (L50) were estimated for longspine flathead, redfish (Centroberyx affinis: Berycidae) and longfin gurnard (Lepidotrigla argus: Triglidae) in the 5-mm 200-mesh codend. The limited size range of school whiting resulted in unreliable estimation of selectivity in the 200-mesh 5-mm twine codend, but this design was the only one that retained a substantial proportion of individuals below the minimum marketable length (15 cm fork length). While the 200-mesh 5-mm twine codend retained commercial quantities of school whiting, it seems far from optimal. It is suggested that a more efficient design comprising possibly smaller, square-shaped meshes should be developed and used in conjunction with temporal, spatial and catch restrictions. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Among the multitude of factors possibly affecting the cod-end selectivity of bottom trawls, in the commercial fishery gear speed and gear size are thought to be of high importance. A binational experiment, funded by the EU, carried out with a German and a Norwegian ship in the period between 1994 and 1997 tested this opinion. Of four data sets collected only two demonstrated a relationship between speed through water and cod-end selectivity. A decrease of haddock selectivity by increased towing speed in one data set was equalled by an increase of cod selectivity in another. Hence, the results of this experiments do not support the hypothesis of an essential effect of trawl speed on the selectivity of the cod-end. Likewise, no significant difference could be detected between the selectivity of the same cod-end attached to one trawl on one hand and to a scaled down version of it on the other. An increase of cod-end selectivity related to catch size was observed in three of six series of hauls. Though being in contradiction to results of other authors a possible explanation is the magnitude of the catches made during the experiments. At this range it is rather probable that with the building up of the catch in the cod-end, the meshes open increasingly, thus improving the selectivity, until a point is reached where it either levels out or begins to decrease. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We use smoothers to show that, for haddock and whiting, all three trawls with square mesh panels are more selective than the net with no panel. For whiting, the nets with a panel in the 6-9 and 9-12 m positions are more selective than the net with a panel in the 3-6 m position. The same result is suggested for haddock, but only at a marginal level of significance. For haddock, we also fit a six-parameter model to a subset of the data and hence find separate estimates of the selectivity of the panel and the cod-end. This model reflects the dual selection process of cod-end and panel and is a better fit to these data than the standard logistic curve. Crown Copyright ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Population estimates of crabs in commercial fisheries are traditionally based on the reported catch and effort, with supplementary sampling by researchers. This study investigated the four gear types most commonly used by fishers and researchers to determine whether their catches are representative of the populations. The selectivity of a large mesh trap, a small-mesh trap, a seine net and an otter trawl catching Portunus pelagicus (blue swimmer crab) in Peel-Harvey Estuary, Western Australia, was examined. Both the seine net and otter trawl caught a wide size range of crabs, although most of the catch was larger than the size at sexual maturity. The sex ratio of crabs caught by these two gear types was close to parity. However, traps caught a narrow size range, almost all of the catch were larger than the size at sexual maturity, and catches were heavily biased towards large males. Therefore, although favored by commercial fishers and for sampling crustacean populations in sensitive and protected areas, trap catches are not representative of the population sampled for blue swimmer crabs. Seine nets or otter trawls should thus be considered in the research assessment of stocks as their catches are more representative of the population. Catchability of all four gear types was found to vary seasonally. The size and sex bias of trap catches appear to be attributable to behavioural differences.

abstract = {Within commercial fisheries, particularly mixed fisheries, both target and non-target species are often discarded. Discarding represents a potentially significant loss to the productivity of fish stocks; it can have damaging ecological consequences, and is a potential cause of the failure of recovery plans. The Nephrops fishery in the North Sea is classified as a mixed fishery. Nephrops trawls are constructed with smaller meshes than trawls used to target whitefish; consequently, the bycatch of juvenile fish can be substantial. Several new Nephrops trawl designs have been tested in the North Sea. The data from these trials are used to investigate the potential impact of their implementation on cod, haddock and whiting stocks in the North Sea (including the Kattegat and Skagerrak). The model examines five trawl designs, and also the scenarios of a cessation of discarding in all North Sea fisheries and in just the Nephrops fishery. The model is deterministic, and evaluates the relative differences between scenarios assuming all other variables remain constant. If discarding of cod, haddock and whiting in the North Sea fisheries were eliminated, stocks would increase by 41{\%}, 14{\%} and 29{\%}, respectively, within 10 years. Eliminating discarding in the Nephrops fishery alone would increase stocks by 2{\%}, 1{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively, reflecting the relative proportion of catches of these species in the Nephrops fishery. For cod and haddock, the introduction of the Nephrops trawl with a grid with a square-mesh codend was the only scenario in which a notable increase in stock number was observed. This trawl design facilitates the escape of fish of all ages/sizes from the trawl, effectively making the Nephrops fishery a single-species fishery. For whiting, stock numbers and landings increased under all scenarios, but forecasted landings were lower than if current discard patterns continued in all except the no-discards scenario. The dependency of the results on the validity of the assumptions and on the accuracy of the input data is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mediterranean demersal trawl fisheries traditionally operate using small diamond-shape meshes in the codend, which tend to retain almost all animals. We investigated the effect of mesh configuration on the size selectivity of nine species (the scaldfish Arnoglossus laterna, the broad-tail shortfin squid Illex coindettii, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the red mullet Mullus barbatus, the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, the common pandora Pagellus erythrinus, the deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the Mediterranean horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus and the poor-cod Trisopterus minutus capelanus) commonly captured in the Mediterranean demersal trawls. Two codends having meshes with the same opening (ca. 38 mm) but different mesh configuration (DM38: diamond-mesh and SM38: square-mesh configuration) were fished daily and alternately on the same trawl. They demonstrated a substantial improvement in selectivity with square-mesh. Selectivity was measured using the covered codend technique, the cover being supported by circular hoops. The results were analysed taking into account the between-haul variation in selectivity. Two other important external variables were identified: the trawling depth and the codend catch, which for some species influenced between-haul variation, but there was no evidence of a coherent effect on selectivity parameters. The selectivity of 40 mm diamond-mesh codend has been reported to be rather poor because a large proportion of the codend catch is immature and smaller than the minimum landing size (MLS) or first maturity size. With the exception of the flatfish (A. laterna), the effect of a change of mesh configuration from diamond- to square-mesh on size selectivity positively affected the retention length at 50{\%} (L50). However, square-meshes were found to be unsuitable for flat and/or deep-bodied fish as these escape more readily from diamond-meshes. The Council Regulation (EC) No. 1967/2006, concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean, establishes the MLS of marine organisms. However, the increase in L50 with square-mesh would not avoid some of the existing contradictions in allowing the use of codend mesh which leads to lower L50 than the MLS. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Experiments were carried out during three cruises in the period 1997-1999, to develop and test a sorting grid system in the North Sea industrial trawl fishery for Norway pout. The system should separate bycatch species like haddock, whiting and other human consumption species from the main target species Norway pout, and other target species like blue whiting, etc. During the first cruise a prototype of the grid system was developed and tested with different mountings of guiding panel in front of the grid and with different spacing (25, 22 and 19 mm) between bars. The last two surveys tested if the mesh size in the grid section and the thickness of the bars influenced the selectivity of the grid system. Two different mesh sizes and three different thicknesses of bars were tested. Based on the results from the 1997 experiments, only a bar space of 22 mm were used in the later experiments. The 1998 and 1999 experiments were carried out in different seasons (May and September/October) to test the system on different size distributions of target and bycatch species. Hydrodynamic studies of the grid system using the two different mesh sizes and the three different thickness of bars were conducted in a flume tank, and a 25{\%} difference was found in water flow speed behind grids with 22 mm bar spacing but with different thickness of bars (15, 10 and 5 mm). During the 1998 experiment a total of 94.6{\%} (weight) of the bycatch species was sorted out with a 32.8{\%} loss of target species. In the 1999 experiment 62.4{\%} of the bycatch species were sorted out and the loss of target species was 22{\%}. When testing selectivity parameters for haddock, the main bycatch species, the parameters indicated a sharp size selection in the grid system. Size selection differences between different configurations of the grid system are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Three designs of grid were tested including two constructed from stainless steel and one from plastic. The effectiveness of the grids was assessed by comparing the catches from the twin beam trawls used in this fishery. One beam trawl was fitted with the grid the other kept as standard. The by-catch levels of plaice, Pleuronectes plattessa, and whiting, Merlangius merlangus were reduced significantly, with no significant loss of shrimp, C. crangon. The selectivity of the grids were determined by two methods, first by comparing the numbers at length retained in each trawl and, second by the fitting of a small mesh retention cover over the escape hole of the grid. Selectivity parameters were obtained for both species. The selectivity of two further bar spacing was assessed for the final design of grid. The biological consequences of introducing the grids into the shrimp fleet of the European Union are discussed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Few of these fish were retained by the normal cod-end, either with or without the square-mesh panel, suggesting that fitting the square mesh panel did not appreciably improve the selectivity of the cod-end design used in these trials. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results were analysed taking into account between-haul variation in selectivity, and indicate a significant increase in L50 for rose shrimp with an increase in mesh size or with the use of a square mesh cod end, while for Norway lobster only mesh configuration was found to affect this parameter. Two other important external variables were identified; the trawling depth and the cod end catch, which influence between-haul variation, by increasing the selection range for rose shrimp and Norway lobster, respectively. The results obtained suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 mm would be advisable for rose shrimp in order to respect the minimum landing size of 24 mm carapace length presently established for this species. Moreover, trawling for rose shrimp should be avoided at depths above 200 m, in order to avoid catches consisting almost exclusively of juveniles. Such an increase in mesh size would have a minor impact in terms of losses of individuals above the minimum landing size for Norway lobster and would contribute to reducing the amount of discards in this fishery. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A conventional 70 mm Nephrops codend and a similar codend with a 90 mm square mesh panel window inserted in the top panel were tested simultaneously in a twin trawl rig. Selectivity parameters and differences in catches of the target species Nephrops and the by-catch species whiting, haddock and cod were estimated. The logistic function was found to give the best description of fish selection ogives, whereas the asymmetric complementary loglog function described Nephrops selection best. The Fryer model was used to describe and compare the selection ogives for haddock, whiting, cod and Nephrops in the two codends. Due to low catches of cod and Nephrops only four out of 11 hauls could be used for modelling the selection of these two species. Selection factor and selection range were larger for the window codend for all fish species. The codend catch size had a significant negatively correlated influence on l50 and selection range for whiting in the window codend. There were large significant reductions in numbers of cod and haddock under the Danish MLS with the window codend. Catches of small cod, however, were low. Very few whiting under MLS were retained in either codend but there was a large significant reduction in individuals over MLS with the window codend. A large proportion of the Nephrops in the codends were under MLS. A reduction in catch weight of Nephrops over MLS was found for the window codend, but catches of Nephrops were low for several hauls.},

abstract = {The Nephrops trawl fishery is one of the most important fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent high discard levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30{\%} survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e.g. rent) are examined and a cost-benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have high level of discards. Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units. By taking account of the economic dynamics of increasing effort however, we show that selectivity measures are insufficient. Regulating access to the fishery is also required to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and a better exploitation of the production potential. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Chopin1995,
abstract = {The capture of immature fish in many commercial fisheries is controlled by restricting the use of fishing gears or elements of fishing gears that prevent the escape of immature fish. Improving the selective characteristics of fishing gear is based on the assumption that fish escaping are not seriously damaged and able to make a complete recovery. If fish escape and die as a direct result of stress and injuries or indirectly due to disease and predation associated with gear damage, then increasing the opportunity for escape by improving selectivity may result in an increased level of unaccounted fishing mortality. This paper identifies the main fishing gear types used for harvesting marine and freshwater fish, a range of injuries, stress reactions and mortalities that can occur during capture and escape. It is concluded that immediate and delayed mortalities can occur in fish escaping from fishing gears and that the high variation in mortality rates within experiments is associated with a lack of information on how fish condition is affected by various fishing stressors and the type and severity of physical damage received. Improving selectivity without reducing damage or stress incurred during capture and escape may not be the most appropriate way of protecting immature fish. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Size selective grids were introduced into the Barents Sea demersal trawl fishery in 1997. It was believed at the time that in comparison to standard diamond mesh codends, grids had better selective properties, i.e. narrower selection range. Few studies have directly compared the selective properties of the combined grid and codend with that of the codend only. In this study we describe two experiments carried out in 2002 and 2003, where we directly compared the properties of codend selectivity for cod (Gadus morhua) with the combined selectivity of a Sort-V grid and a codend. In 2002 we used small-meshed covers, whereas the twin trawl method was used in 2003. In both experiments we compared the selectivity of a 135 mm codend only with that of a trawl fitted with a 135 mm codend and a 55 mm grid, which is the mandatory configuration. In 2003 we also estimated the selectivity of a 155 mm diamond mesh codend, having an L50 similar to that of the grid and 135 mm codend combination. The results presented no evidence that the grid and mesh combination had sharper size selection than codend meshes. The introduction of the mandatory use of grid in the fishery in 1997 therefore only increased L50, and corresponded to a mesh size increase of around 20 mm. Mean selection length of the grid was inversely related to catch rates in the 2002 experiment when large catches were taken. Grid selection appeared less affected by seasonal variations in degree of stomach fullness or condition than mesh selectivity. Other situations where grid selection might perform better than mesh selection are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The selectivity of fishing gear can vary considerably from set to set even when deployment is replicated under controlled conditions. Analysis of data from size-selectivity experiments will be misleading if this between-deployment variability is not taken into consideration. Here, two approaches are presented for including the effect of between-haul variability when performing size-selectivity experiments for trawls. The first is a simple ad hoc approach that provides a "catch-all" estimate of variability that also takes into account the effect of subsampling the catches. The second is a formal model of random between-haul variability that is fitted via maximum likelihood. The two approaches are applied to both covered-codend and twin-trawl selectivity experiments. The first method is seen to be more intuitive and interpretable, especially when selectivity may depend on catch size, but is limited in its ability to cope with complex experimental designs. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Commercial fishing trials with 40 mm diamond (DM40) and square (SM40) mesh codends made of 5 mm diameter knotted PE-netting were conducted in July 2005 on the continental shelf (???100 m) and upper slope (???400 m) of the Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean) to assess the size selectivity of European hake (Merluccius merluccius), Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), poor cod (Trisopterus minutus) and greater forkbeard (Phycis blennoides) in the demersal multi-species trawl fishery. In total, 28 tows were done using the standard covered codend method. For all four species, the SM40 showed a significantly higher mean selection length (L 50) than the DM40. For hake the L 50 was 16.0 cm in SM40 and 10.1 cm in DM40; the corresponding figures were 13.0 cm versus 9.2 cm for poor cod and 14.9 cm versus 9.8 cm for greater forkbeard. For Norway lobster, DM40 did not show any size-selectivity whereas SM40 produced a L 50 of 22 mm. The selection range (SR) between DM40 and SM40 was not significantly (p {\textgreater} 0.05) different for any of the three fish species. Our trials indicate that substantial improvement in size-selectivity for these commercially important species is achieved by switching from the conventional 40 mm diamond mesh codend to a 40 mm square mesh codend. Our analysis also suggests that by using a 40 mm square mesh codend the short-term economic losses of commercial species, compared to the losses of 40 mm diamond mesh codend, will be low in the slope fishery (less than ???5{\%} of the total catch value), whereas in the continental shelf losses could be up to ???30{\%} of the total catch value. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The objective of this project was to develop a trawl suitable for directed fisheries for flatfish that would reduce cod bycatch. A selective flatfish trawl was developed and tested in a flume tank. A sea trial was conducted in the Danish plaice fishery in the Skagerrak and two sea trials were run on the Baltic sea flounder fishery. The catches from the selective flatfish trawl were compared to catches made with a conventional flatfish trawl. The selective flatfish trawl caught more plaice and reduced the cod bycatch, particularly those smaller than the minimum landing size in the Skagerrak sea trials, compared to the conventional flatfish trawl. The selective flatfish trawl caught more flounder and reduced cod bycatch during two sea trials in the Baltic sea. Hence, this selective flatfish trawl appears to be a useful management tool to substantially reduce bycatch of cod in a directed plaice or flounder fishery. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The critical condition of the North Sea cod stocks has resulted in restrictions on not only cod, but also haddock and other species that are caught together with cod. Thus full exploitation of the haddock stock is unachievable unless cod can be excluded from the haddock catch. We designed a selective trawl based on the behavioral differences between haddock and cod as they enter a trawl, i.e., cod stay close to the seabed whereas haddock rise above it. The trawl's fishing line is raised ∼60 cm above the seabed to allow cod to escape beneath the trawl while haddock are retained. To collect the escapees, three sampling bags were attached beneath the raised fishing line. The selective haddock trawl reduced the total catch of cod by 55{\%} during the day and 82{\%} at night, and 99{\%} of the marketable haddock was caught during the day and 89{\%} at night. Cod escape rates were highly length dependent: smaller cod escaped the trawl in greater numbers than did larger individuals. Whiting, saithe, lemon sole, and plaice were included in the analysis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The declining cod stock in the Baltic Sea has highlighted a need for the use of more selective fishing gears. From 1995, the use of 105-mm 'Danish' and 'Swedish' designed escape windows was adopted into legislation in the Baltic Sea, as alternatives to a mesh size increase from 105 to 120 mm. As the legislation was based on very few experiments, one objective of this work was to collect more selectivity data on a 'Danish' window codend. The second objective was to test if black netting sections could be used as contrasting colours to manipulate the cod behaviour, and further improve the escape through the window. Experiments were conducted from a commercial vessel. The selectivity of window codends with contrasting colours and conventional green netting, were measured simultaneously using hooped codend covers and a twin trawl rig. Comparative fishing experiments were then conducted using uncovered codends. No significant improvement in the escape of cod was found for the three different types of codends with contrasting colours tested in the experiments. The overall selection factor for cod estimated by combining 25 hauls for a codend with a 115-mm square mesh 'Danish' window was 2.84. This is lower than estimates from other experiments with window codends in the Baltic Sea. A significant, but relatively weak, codend catch size effect on the selectivity parameters was found.},

abstract = {A full-scale fishing experiment on north-east Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), involving a trawler, a longliner and a gillnetter was conducted in order to determine how the length distributions and life history parameters of the catches were affected by gear type. Relative selectivity was analysed for catches taken when the boats fished simultaneously in the same area, and when the skippers were allowed to fish under conditions as close as possible to commercial operation. Trawl and longline-caught cod had similar length distributions, but cod caught by trawl were on average 2.3 cm smaller than longline-caught cod. Cod caught by longline had a lower condition factor and length at age. The longliner caught smaller haddock than the trawler when the boats fished in the same area. When the skippers were allowed to change fishing ground, the mean length of cod increased in the trawl catches and became larger than the mean length in the longline catches. The mean length of haddock in the longline catches increased by 2.8 cm and became larger than that of the trawl catches. Gillnet catches consisted almost solely of large cod. Mean length of gillnet caught fish in 186 mm nets decreased from 86.2 cm to 82.3 cm even if the boat did not change area. Separate selectivity experiments for trawl and gillnet were conducted, and the parameters for the mesh selection are presented. To find the functional form of the longline selectivity we used relative catch proportion in each 5 cm length-group for longline compared to trawl and gillnet, whose selectivities were assumed to be known. When compared to that of the gillnet, the plots indicate that the longline selectivity curve takes the form of a unimodal distribution. When longline catches was compared to trawl catches none of the suggested models seemed to fit, and to conclude anything about the form of the longline selection curve is not possible.},

abstract = {Two sorting grid systems with three different bar spacings for size selecting mackerel in pelagic trawls have been tested during four surveys. In the mackerel fishery, the value of the catch depends on fish size; the largest mackerel are priced substantially higher than the smaller fish. Using a grid-selection system to improve size selection in this fishery would therefore increase fishermen's income. Between 8 and 51{\%} of each catch was sorted during 12 hauls, with catch weights ranging from less than 300 kg to more than 170 000 kg. There were significant differences in individual mean weight between mackerel that passed through the grid and mackerel retained in the codend in all hauls as a result of the reduction in the proportion of mackerel below 400 g, and an increase in the mackerel above 600 g. Using 1999 prices as the standard, grid selection increased the value of these hauls from 8 to 18{\%}. Selectivity parameters are presented for all hauls and show that the sorting grid delivered a reasonably sharp size selection in all hauls. Four different models are presented to explore the selection data, and possible influence of catch size on selectivity parameters is tested. Data on grid angle and water flow through the grid are presented from four hauls. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Technical measures such as gear restrictions are commonly used in European fisheries management. Many of the measures are aimed primarily at protecting juveniles. Although they are assumed to provide both biological and economic benefits, proper evaluation of their effects relative to what is intended is often not possible because of a lack of adequate follow-up studies. Moreover, technical measures usually are used in conjunction with other management measures, which greatly complicate the analysis. We describe the principal factors affecting their effectiveness to find the approaches that may help to improve performance. Many regulations are enforced inconsistently, and their implementation is often less restrictive than originally intended. Moreover, trying to solve one problem frequently creates new ones. The successful use of technical measures appears to depend largely on their acceptance by industry. Measures that increase costs or reduce earnings are unattractive, so if short-term effects are not accounted for, the potential long-term gains may never materialize. Successful management actions have addressed these problems. Although technical measures may conserve resource, particularly to supplement a broader management policy, new regulations should be planned with great care, and any measures should be tested properly before implementation.},

abstract = {Strengthening bags are used in demersal trawl fisheries to prevent the cod-end from bursting when it is being lifted aboard the vessel. Very little is known, however, concerning their effect on the selective properties of the cod-end. This paper reports on covered cod-end experiments to measure the selective performance of a 110 mm cod-end and a 120 mm cod-end, both with and without strengthening bags attached. The design and position of the strengthening bag satisfy current EU regulations. Results were obtained only for haddock. The l50 of the 110 mm cod-end with a strengthening bag was ???29.5 cm and was ???31.4 cm without a strengthening bag. The selection range in each case was ???4.5 cm. For the 120 mm cod-end, the l50 was ???32.4 cm with a strengthening bag and ???34.3 cm without a strengthening bag and the selection range in each case was ???5.2 cm. The standard error estimates of each of these parameters were small. These results indicate that the combination of recent Scottish legislation to ban strengthening bags and technical conservation measures of the EU Commission to increase the minimum mesh size from 110 to 120 mm may have increased the 50{\%} retention length of the cod-ends used by the Scottish whitefish fleet by up to 4.8 cm. This may be an overestimate however, since it does not take into account the 90 mm square mesh panel that had to be inserted in the 110 mm mesh cod-end.

abstract = {On 8 March 2001, the Scottish Fisheries Minister announced to the Scottish Parliament that o1m would be made available for "a new partnership involving scientists and the fishing industry which will see fishing boats chartered to trial innovative gear to improve gear selectivity". As a result, the project became known as the Industry/Science Partnership. This was part of a much larger package worth o27m offering decommissioning and funding for the processing industry as well. The Industry/Science Partnership funds were administered through SEERAD and a Steering Committee involving the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, FRS Marine Laboratory, Seafish Industry Authority and the North Atlantic Fisheries College, as well as SEERAD, was set up to plan and carry out a range of projects. This report focuses on the projects to study the factors affecting selectivity and the assessment of the effect of more selective gears on catches and discards. A separate report describes projects aiming to improve knowledge of fish biology and distribution in Scottish waters. In addition to the gear work specifically funded through this initiative, the report also includes three other projects funded separately by SEERAD as part of the FRS annual programme in the years 2000 and 2001. The reason for including them here is that they are an integral part of the objectives to study the effect of square mesh panel position, a key issue in current technical conservation measures. A list of the gear trials reported in this document (Table 1) shows that there were 14 separate trips obtaining information on whitefish from 8 twin trawls, 2 Scottish seines, 2 single trawls, 1 pair seine and 1 pair trawl. Nephrops data were collected from 3 single trawls and 1 twin trawl. Nephrops and whitefish data were gathered from 2 dual purpose twin trawls. Individual reports from each vessel trip can be found in section 5. A summary of the key findings is found in section 4, grouped by topic - whitefish mesh size; whitefish panel position; whitefish multiple panels; Prawn mesh size; prawn panel position; prawn panel twine thickness; by-catch reduction in prawn trawls; extension length; towing speed; lifting bag; colour of netting; grids and panels.

abstract = {Selection curves of small mesh trawls were assessed with one alternate haul and two trouser trawl experiments. The effect of fish length on the ratio (pi) of the number of fish of length i caught in the large mesh cod-end to the number of fish of length i caught in both cod-ends was estimated with generalized linear modeling. The alternate haul experiment was conducted with beam trawls equipped with 2 and 18 mm stretched mesh cod-ends to assess size selectivity for perch Perca fluviatilis. None of the perch that entered the cod-end could escape through the mesh of the small mesh cod-end. For small perch ({\textless}ca. 10 cm total length), pi reflected the ratio in areas swept by the large and small mesh nets, but for larger perch, pi increased. Water flow through the small mesh net must have been lower than through the large mesh net, enabling relatively more larger perch ({\textgreater}ca. 10 cm total length) to out-swim the small mesh net. The trouser trawl experiments were conducted to study selectivity for smelt Osmerus eperlanus, using 12 and 22 mm stretched mesh cod-ends, and for American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides, using 39 and 155 mm stretched mesh cod-ends (published data). During both trouser trawl experiments, smaller fish that entered the cod-end could escape through the large mesh cod-ends, so pi increased with increasing fish size. However, also beyond the size where fish could escape through the large mesh cod-end, pi continued to increase. This implied that the small mesh cod-end was less selective to larger fish. We demonstrated that the lower selectivity to larger fish in the cod-end with the smaller mesh could result in 20-50{\%} overestimation of the length (L50) at which 50{\%} of the fish entering the cod-end escape through the mesh. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thus, a quota-based system may not be sufficient to sustain the stock. A bio-economic simulation and optimisation model was used to explore how various area closures in combination with the quota-system affect levels of by-catch, net profit of individual fleet segments from different ports, and stock development in that fishery. Tested area closures differed in duration, size and location relative to major ports and to seasonal movement patterns of species. These closures were tested under variable recruitment. Area closures that were covering the seasonal migration route of saithe revealed almost two times greater increases in spawning stock biomass than closures that were not covering the migration route. Even area closures where a high dispersal rate of individuals was assumed resulted in increased spawning stock biomass of saithe. Benefits of the tested area closures were distributed heterogeneously among individual fleet segments. Increases of saithe stock size were offset by increases in cod by-catch. The location of an area closure relative to the home port of fleet segments decided if steaming costs increased and catches decreased.},

abstract = {In March 2007 the Commission published a policy proposal to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards1 along side an Impact Assessment2. These two documents set out a policy proposal and analysis of the discards problem and options to tackle the issue in European fisheries. However, these documents were only a first step. The Communication recognised that a plan for implementation for specific fisheries would have to be developed to assess impacts on a fishery by fishery basis. Commission Impact Assessments (IA) are guided by the procedures set out in the Commission's Impact Assessment Guidelines (SEC(2005)791). These go beyond the 'assessment' process to embrace factors such as stakeholder consultation and the use of technical expertise. The IA process is considered a set of six steps which structure the preparation of policy proposals (IA guidelines, section I.1): 1. identify the problem; 2. define the objectives; 3. develop main policy options; 4. analyse their impacts; 5. compare the options; and 6. outline policy monitoring and evaluation. Wth respect to discards, the Commission has already identified the problem (step 1) and defined the policy objectives (step 2). It has also outlined the main policy options that will be considered (step 3). This project is therefore intended to address steps 4 to 6, or more specifically, develop a procedure to be followed for IA with respect to policy action in individual fisheries. The study was divided into three main tasks: 1. a review of EU and international experience on reduction of discards; 2. the preparation of a methodological framework for the analysis of economic, social and biological impacts of Commission policy proposals to address discards, elaborating the Commission Impact assessment guidelines; and 3. an evaluation of five options for implementing the proposed EU Discard Policy},

abstract = {A key objective of the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy reforms is the elimination of discards and a reduction in unwanted catches. Combining a discard ban with catch quotas, where all fish, independent of size, count towards quotas could create economic incentives for more selective fishing, reducing unwanted catches. We use fishing activities data from English North Sea otter trawlers to examine the impact of these measures on this fleet. Initial impacts depend on the scale of increase and distribution of quotas and are unevenly distributed, depending on catch and discard characteristics of vessels. Selective fishing will be rewarded as vessels that currently have low discards could increase catches and profits. Fishing by less selective vessels will be curtailed, reducing profits by 1-14{\%}. This could be partially mitigated through reducing regulated catches but will require changes to fishing patterns as using currently available selective fishing gears may impact on profitability. So, catch quotas and a discard ban create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices, but also for non-compliance with full documentation of catches. A high level of monitoring and enforcement will be required to ensure that fishers improve profitability through more selective fishing practices rather than illegal discarding.},

Yet, because of the difficulties in matching quota holdings with catches, many argue that IFQs are not appropriate for multispecies fisheries. Using on-the-ground-experience with multispecies IFQ fisheries in Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, we assess the design and use of catch-quota balancing mechanisms. Our methodology includes a mix of interviews with fishery managers, industry representatives, and brokers, literature review, and data analysis. We find that a combination of incentives and limits on use rates for the mechanisms provide sufficient flexibility to the quota owner without the fishery manager incurring excessive levels of overexploitation risk. Contrary to some opinions, these programs are evidence that it is possible to implement IFQ programs for multispecies fisheries and that they can be profitable and sustainable. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {A discrete choice model is applied to determine how fishing effort is allocated spatially and temporally by the English and Welsh North Sea beam trawl fleet. Individual vessels can fish in five distinct areas, and the utility of fishing in an area depends on expected revenue measured as previous success (value per unit effort) and experience (past fishing effort allocation), as well as perceived costs (measured as distance to landing port weighted by fuel price). The model predicts fisher location choice, and the predictions are evaluated using iterative partial cross validation by fitting the model over a series of separate time-periods (nine separate time-periods). Results show the relative importance of the different drivers that change over time. They indicate that there are three main drivers throughout the study, past annual effort, past monthly effort in the year of fishing, and fuel price, largely reflecting the fact that previous practices where success was gained are learned (i.e. experience) and become habitual, and that seasonal variations also dominate behaviour in terms of the strong monthly trends and variable costs. In order to provide an indication of the model's predictive capabilities, a simulated closure of one of the study areas was undertaken (an area that mapped reasonably well with the North Sea cod 2001 partial closure of the North Sea for 10 weeks of that year). The predicted reallocation of effort was compared against realized/observed reallocation of effort, and there was good correlation at the trip level, with a maximum 10{\%} misallocation of predicted effort for that year. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

We find that, as predicted by theory, areas with higher monetary and non-monetary costs have consistently higher catch rates than areas with lower costs. We show that this theory also predicts that an increase in price would result in an overall increase in catch rate, and suggest that in fisheries with spatial variation in costs, catch rates may be determined as much by economic factors as biological ones.},

abstract = {Reforms of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will implement an EU wide ban on discarding phased in from 2015, requiring the landing of unwanted small and unmarketable fish. The Commission argues that this will create strong incentives for more selective fishing practices; however, there is little information to allow us to predict likely changes in fishing behaviour. Using detailed historic observer and logbook data from English North Sea otter trawlers and information on fish prices and landing costs, we examine the potential impact of a discard ban combined with either effort controls or catch quotas on the landings of an average trip. We calculate fishing incomes based on the assumption that existing fishing behaviour and catch compositions are maintained and compare this with incomes calculated on the assumption that all unwanted catch can be avoided. The difference provides an estimate of the maximum possible financial incentive for fishers to adopt more selective fishing practices. The calculations suggest that a discard ban in isolation will generate little economic incentive to operate more selectively. When combined with effort controls, a reduction in fishing effort may result in a proportional reduction in unwanted catches, but an incentive to actively avoid this catch is unlikely to be generated. Catch quotas would generate much stronger economic incentives, but only for the avoidance of the five quota species. So, contrary to the aims of the reformed CFP, a discard ban may not result in a dramatic reduction in unmarketable catches of all species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Long-term, seasonal and spatial patterns in spawning activity of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) along the continental shelf west of Europe were investigated. Stage I egg densities from all eight available international, triennial surveys (1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995 and 1998) were modelled using generalized additive models. The data showed that seasonal and spatial patterns of spawning activity varied inter-annually. Total annual egg production peaked in 1989 with minima in 1983 and 1998. Further examination of these trends (1977-1998) showed that the intensity of spawning activity has shifted location, declining in the south and rising in the north. There was no direct link between stage I egg densities and sea surface temperature, although the rate of temperature increase along the shelf edge was strongly related to the total annual egg production by the mackerel},

This paper illustrates that existing tools often available in actively managed fisheries can be linked together into an effective management strategy evaluation framework. Spatial closures tended to succeed with respect to their specific design objective, but this benefit did not necessarily flow to other broad-scale objectives. This demonstrates that there is no single management tool which satisfies all objectives, and that a suite of management tools is needed.},

abstract = {A Management Strategy Evaluation framework is used to evaluate management strategies based on input controls for the fishery for two tiger prawn species (Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus) in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery. Three "assessment procedures" are considered and two forms of decision rule. The performance of the management strategies is evaluated in terms of whether stocks are left at (or above) the spawning stock size at which Maximum Sustainable Yield is achieved (SMSY), the long-term discounted total catch and the extent of inter-annual variation in catches. The focus of the analysis is on management strategies based on the current method of stock assessment because an alternative method of assessment based on a biomass dynamics model is found to be highly variable. None of the management strategies tested is able to leave the spawning stock size of P. esculentus near SMSY if the target effort level used in the management strategy is set to EMSY. Accounting for stock structure through the application of a spatially- (stock-) structured assessment approach fails to resolve this problem. Since the assessment method is generally close to unbiased, the failure to leave the stocks close to SMSY is because the measure of control is total effort and the two species are found (and caught) together. Reducing the target effort level to below EMSY increases the final stock size, but the reduced risk comes at a cost of reduced catches. The best management strategy in terms of leaving both species close to SMSY is found to be one that changes the timing of the fishing season so that effort is shifted from P. esculentus to P. semisulcatus and sets more precautionary effort targets for P. esculentus. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Northern Prawn Fishery harvests a variety of prawn species including some short-lived species with highly variable recruitment such as banana prawns and slightly longer-lived tiger prawns with less variable recruitment. An evaluation of stock assessment methods and management strategies for the Northern Prawn Fishery using the management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach requires an (operating) model of the resource to act as the 'truth' for the analyses. A five-stock, two tiger prawn species operating model with a weekly time-step is developed and conditioned using more than 30 years of logbook catch and effort data as well as the results of fishery-independent research. The operating model is projected beyond the present using stock-specific stock-recruitment relationships. Banana prawns are not modelled explicitly, but their impact on the management system is simulated empirically. The input control nature of the management system is mimicked using an effort allocation model that allocates effort by species, area and week. This model allows for the impact of changes over time in efficiency, a key uncertainty in the assessment of these species, and the impact of management implementation error, which has historically been substantial. Some of the properties of the operating model are illustrated by projections based on a constant effort policy. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The impacts of climate change on fish and fisheries is expected to increase the demand for more accurate stock projections and harvest strategies that are robust to shifting production regimes. To address these concerns, we evaluate the performance of fishery management control rules for eastern Bering Sea walleye pollock stock under climate change. We compared the status quo policy with six alternative management strategies under two types of recruitment pattern simulations: one that follows temperature-induced trends and the other that follows a stationary recruitment pattern similar to historical observations. A subset of 82 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate models provided temperature inputs from which an additional 100 stochastic simulated recruitments were generated to obtain the same overall recruitment variability as observed for the stationary recruitment simulations. Results indicate that status quo management with static reference points and current ecosystem considerations will result in much lower average catches and an increased likelihood of fishery closures, should reduced recruitment because of warming conditions hold. Alternative reference point calculations and control rules have similar performance under stationary recruitment relative to status quo, but may offer significant gains under the changing environmental conditions.},

Stock assessment and projections incorporating discard estimates in some years: an application to the hake stock in ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa. {\^{a}}€“ ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1185{\^{a}}€“1197. A Bayesian age-structured stock assessment model is developed to take into account available information on discards and to handle gaps in the time-series of discard estimates. The model incorporates mortality attributable to discarding, and appropriate assumptions about how this mortality may change over time are made. The result is a stock assessment that accounts for information on discards while, at the same time, producing a complete time-series of discard estimates. The method is applied to the hake stock in ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa, for which the available data indicate that some 60{\%} of the individuals caught are discarded. The stock is fished by Spain and Portugal, and for each country, there are discard estimates for recent years only. Moreover, the years for which Portuguese estimates are available are only a subset of those with Spanish estimates. Two runs of the model are performed; one assuming zero discards and another incorporating discards. When discards are incorporated, estimated recruitment and fishing mortality for young (discarded) ages increase, resulting in lower values of the biological reference points Fmax and F0.1 and, generally, more optimistic future stock trajectories under F-reduction scenarios.},

abstract = {The current status of the whiskery shark (Furgaleus macki) stock in south-western Australia was assessed using an age and sex structured model. The best estimates of total and mature biomass in 1997/1998 were 38.8{\%} of virgin, and 23.0{\%} of virgin, respectively. The 95{\%} confidence intervals for total biomass were 22.7-47.2{\%}, and for mature biomass were 13.4-36.4{\%}. Thirteen scenarios were used to test the sensitivity of the model to catch and effort, biological, and gear parameters. The estimates of current biomass were most sensitive to variations in catch and effort data. A scenario testing the use of raw catch and effort data produced unrealistically low estimates of current biomass, while a scenario testing the hypothesis that there had been no efficiency increases in the fishery over time indicated that biomass was currently higher than indicated by the best estimate. The remainder of the scenarios tested produced estimates of total biomass between 32 and 40{\%} of virgin, and mature biomass between 21 and 30{\%} of virgin. Risk analysis was used to test three biological reference points: that the total biomass would be at least 40{\%} of virgin by 2010/2011 (a management committee target), that the total biomass in 2010/2011 will not be below that of 1996/1997, and that the stock would collapse. The results of risk analysis indicates that to achieve at least a 50{\%} probability for the first two biological reference points, annual catches would need to be below 190 tonnes until 2010. The probability of a population crash before 2010 is approximately 5{\%} when future catches are 175 tonnes, and greater than 50{\%} when catches are above 280 tonnes. Risk analysis indicates that there is a need to substantially reduce commercial catches if the target set by the management committee is to be met. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The status of a fishery stock is often determined by comparing an indicator reference point (e.g., current fishing mortality) with a management reference point (e.g., F0.1). Both references are likely subject to large uncertainty. Thus, it is necessary to incorporate such uncertainties in determining the status of fisheries. The composite risk assessment method, which is commonly used in civil engineering, can be used to quantify uncertainty associated with both indicator and management references in evaluating the status of a fishery. Ignoring either part of the uncertainty may result in overexploitation in fisheries management. We applied this method to the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fishery of eastern Newfoundland and Labrador. The results suggest that the uncertainties in both indicator and management reference points can influence the evaluation of the fishery stock status. Uncertainty can come from different sources and is difficult to quantify. We suggest conducting a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative importance of uncertainties resulting from different sources. Such an analysis will enable one to identify key factors influencing the assessment of stock status and management. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To reduce cod mortality in the$\backslash$nNorth$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSea, mesh sizes were increased and effort restrictions introduced,$\backslash$nbut$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe measures also affected other fleets, notably those targeting$\backslash$n$\backslash$nNephrops: fishers for that species reduced their mesh size to prevent$\backslash$n$\backslash$nloss of target species and to avoid effort restrictions. Although$\backslash$n$\backslash$nmanagement measures may have resulted in reduced fishing mortality$\backslash$non$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncod, they placed additional pressure on other stocks by encouraging$\backslash$n$\backslash$nvessels to switch gears, and it is likely that discard rates have$\backslash$n$\backslash$nincreased. in the eastern Bering Sea fishery for walleye pollock,$\backslash$nthe$\backslash$n$\backslash$nadoption of more-selective fishing gears was encouraged by regulations$\backslash$n$\backslash$nrequiring fisheries to be curtailed when bycatch rates of prohibited$\backslash$n$\backslash$nspecies are exceeded, leading to underutilization of the target species$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthrough premature closures.

abstract = {Discards are the portion of animal and plant material in the catch that is dumped back at sea. The Common Fisheries Policy plan proposed by the European Commission for 2014–2020 presents a controversial goal: to enforce the landing of fishing discards as a measure to encourage their reduction. This historical and political decision will shape the future of the fishing exploitation in European Seas. Discards generated by European fleets are not negligible, and its reduction is an ecological, socioeconomical and moral imperative. However, it must be achieved through the reduction in discards at source and the promotion of selective and non-destructive gears. We argue it is doubtful that this discard ban will result in an effective reduction of discards. The proposed measure may, in fact, negatively affect ecosystems at all levels of biological hierarchy by disregarding the Ecosystem-Based Approach to Fisheries and the Precautionary Principle. It could negatively impact several species by increasing fishing mortality, also commercial species if discards are not accounted in the total allowable catch. Communities preying on discards will likely be affected. The role discards currently play in the energy turnover of current ecosystems will be modified and should be fully evaluated. The landing of discards will likely generate new markets of fishmeal due to the growing demands for marine living resources. The ban will require substantial public investment to deal with technical problems on board and to control and enforce. Therefore, this measure should be only implemented after rigorous scientific and technical studies have been developed.},

abstract = {Models are key tools for integrating a wide range of system information in a common framework. Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to ‘road test' management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade-offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time. Although it is doubtful that any single management action will be based solely on Atlantis, this modelling approach continues to provide important insights for managers when making natural resource management decisions.},

abstract = {Ecosystem objectives in fisheries management usually flow from high-level national policies or strategies and international agreements. Consequently they are often broadly stated and hence are difficult to incorporate directly in management plans. Predicting the results of any management action is very uncertain because the dynamics of ecosystems are complex and poorly understood. Methods to design and evaluate operational management strategies have advanced considerably in the past decade. These management-strategy-evaluation (MSE) methods rely on simulation testing of the whole management process using performance measures derived from operational objectives. The MSE approach involves selecting (operational) management objectives, specifying performance measures, specifying alternative management strategies, and evaluating these using simulation. The MSE framework emphasizes the identification and modelling of uncertainties, and propagates these through to their effects on the performance measures. The framework is outlined and illustrated by three ecosystem-related applications: management of benthic habitats and broad fish community composition; by-catch of species of high conservation value; and food-chain interactions and dependencies. Challenges to be overcome before broader ecosystem-related objectives can be fully handled are discussed briefly.},

abstract = {Current scientific management objectives for ICES roundfish stocks are to ensure conservation of the biological resource and do not explicitly consider economic or social objectives. For example, there are currently no objectives to maximize the sustainable yield or to reduce variability in total allowable catches (TACs). This is despite the fact that the current system can result in wide annual fluctuations in TAC, limiting the ability of the fishing industry to plan for the future. Therefore, this study evaluated management strategies that stabilized catches by setting bounds on the interannual variability in TACs. An integrated modelling framework was used, which simulated both the real and observed systems and the interactions between system components. This allowed the evaluation of candidate management strategies with respect to the intrinsic properties of the systems, as well as our ability to observe, monitor, assess, and control them. Strategies were evaluated in terms of risk (measured as the probability of spawning-stock biomass falling below a biomass threshold for the stock) and cumulative yield. In general, bounds on interannual TAC change of 10{\%} and 20{\%} affected the ability to achieve management targets, although the outcome of applying TAC bounds could not have been pre-judged because results were highly dependent on the specific biology of the stock, current status, and the interaction with assessment and management. For example, for North Sea haddock, management became less responsive to fluctuations resulting from large recruitment events. Simulated target fishing mortality levels were rarely achieved, regardless of the TAC bound applied, and actual fishing mortality rates oscillated around the target. In the longer term, more restrictive bounds resulted in oscillations of greater amplitude and wavelength in yield and SSB. Bounds had less effect when a stock was close to the biomass corresponding to the target F. Risk for stocks that are declining or currently at low abundance may be greater, because if bounds restrict the extent to which TACs can be reduced each year, they could lead to collapse of the stock and the loss of all future revenue. However, for a recovered stock or one at high abundance, the loss of yield as a result of bounds would be smaller than that caused by the total collapse of the fishery. At low stock size or if the stock was declining, catches should be changed more rapidly than when the stock was increasing or at a high level, especially high stock sizes acting as an insurance against uncertainty. Therefore, rebuilding strategies, and strategies aimed at maintaining the stock above prescribed limits, should be considered separately. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

A model of choice of assemblage (bottom rockfish (Sebastes sp.) versus deepwater Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus) complex) within a fishing trip was parameterized with data from an observer study conducted in 1988 through 1990. The model predicted that the vessel would fish the bottom rockfish strategy exclusively without limits but would switch between strategies several times under restrictive trip limits. That higher limits increased switching was consistent with actual landings from trips made by the same vessels under the same trip limit regimes, although the actual landings were more variable. Different trip limits or different market prices for the limited species changed the predicted decisions. Changing the cost of fishing each strategy, probability of a premature trip ending, tow duration, and time between tows also changed the predicted decisions, but the input parameters had to be well outside the range of values observed in the fishery.},

Considering all costs, highgrading can be efficient with physical constraints but it is an unfortunate artifact of ITQs. Whether or not highgrading will occur depends upon the price differential between high and low valued fish, the cost of sorting and discarding and the cost of re-harvest.

These estimates are based on a review of over 800 papers. The highest quantities of discards are from the Northwest Pacific while tropical shrimp trawl fisheries generate a higher proportion of discards than any other fishery type, accounting for one third of the global total. Of four major gear groups, shrimp trawls stand alone at the top of the list; bottom trawls, long-lines and pot fisheries come next. The third group consists of Japanese high-seas drift net fisheries, Danish seines and purse seines for capelin. Relatively low levels result from pelagic trawls, small pelagic purse seines and some of high seas drift nets. The authors point to inadequate data to determine the biological, ecological, economic and cultural impacts of discards although economic losses run to billions of dollars. However, it appears most likely that socio-cultural attitudes towards marine resources will guide international discard policies. Techniques to reduce bycatch levels including traditional net selectivity, fishing gear development and time/area restrictions, are discussed. Effort reduction, incentive programmes and individual transferable quotas (that make the vessel responsible for bycatch reduction) are seen as promising avenues for the future. However, quick solutions to the problem are unlikely and much more information is required.},

abstract = {Although bycatch has been an acknowledged component of fishery management for many years, its explosive growth as a major management issue has occurred over the past decade. Emergence of the bycatch issue can be traced to increasing world competition for the ocean's fishery resources and the rapid rise of the conservation and environmental movement in recent years. Bycatch has in the past several years been equated to 'waste', non-selective fishing methods that threaten non-target species and degradation of ocean ecosystems. Although some important steps have been taken to abate bycatch, frequently the problem is not perceived as a component of fishery management, e.g. establishing bycatch mortality rates and evaluating their consequences upon affected populations. Fishery scientists often estimate levels of bycatch, but the overall consequences of discard mortality resulting from the complex of fisheries operating in a region are frequently unknown and speculative. The sum of fishery-induced mortalities occurring as a result of harvesting often involves a significant number of fish in addition to catch and discard. An ICES study group has characterized fishing mortality as the aggregate of all catch mortalities including discard, illegal fishing and misreporting. It is unlikely that managers will, in the near future, have a full accounting of 'unobserved' fishing mortality. Progress toward identifying and measuring such mortalities is receiving increasing attention. The authors suggest and provide an example of a matrix-type analysis for recording bycatch and other fishing mortalities. The matrix presentation would allow managers to evaluate various fishery-related mortality factors and their importance in developing management strategies.},

abstract = {Recent natural or man-made disasters around the world have provided compelling evidence that transportation system plays a crucial role in the emergency evacuation and have stressed the need for effective evacuation traffic management to maximize the utilization of the transportation system and to minimize fatalities and losses. This paper presents a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework for real-time traffic management under emergency evacuation. Distinct from the well-studied evacuation planning, real-time traffic management for evacuation aims to dynamically guide (control) traffic flow under evacuation in such a way that certain system objective (e.g., minimization of fatalities or property losses) could be achieved. The proposed framework is based on both dynamic network modeling techniques and adaptive control theory, by considering the traffic network under evacuation as a dynamic system. First, a prescriptive dynamic traffic assignment model is applied to predict, in a short-term and rolling-horizon manner, the desired traffic states based on certain system optimal objectives. This model will serve as a reference point for the adaptive control. Then, the adaptive control system integrates these desired states and the current prevailing traffic conditions collected via the sensing system to produce real-time traffic control schemes. Finally, these traffic control schemes are implemented in the field to guide the real-world traffic flow to evolve towards the desired states. Simulation studies provided in this paper show that the proposed framework based on MRAC can significantly improve the performance of real-time evacuation traffic management. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

abstract = {Increasing use of spatial management tools in fisheries requires an understanding of fleet response, and in particular to where displaced fishing effort is likely to move. We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of ∼4{\%} higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43{\%} greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season.},

New policy implications of introducing technical change into the standard bioeconomic model are illustrated. Bycatch saving technical change is critical to bycatch reduction and ecosystem based fisheries management, and optimal policies cost-effectively reduce bycatch, create incentives to induce bycatch saving technical change, and establish technology policy for research and development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An algebraic model relating annual changes in harvest rate and catch of various fisheries to the percent of total catch in each fishery contributed by a particular stock is examined to explore implications pertaining to harvest sharing and related escapements. Results indicate that mixed stock fisheries, especially those in which the stock of concern composes a small proportion of the total catch, tend to achieve much of their proportional responsibility for fixed escapement without adjustment of total catch. More terminal fisheries with high contributions from a particular stock must adjust total harvests to achieve similar responsibility. Adjusting total catch of mixed stock fisheries to fully achieve a strict proportional sharing of escapement comes at a cost of many times the number of fish forfeited from the harvest compared to the number of fish added to the stock's escapement. Such additions to the escapement are often insubstantial. Harvest adjustments in single stock fisheries, however, provide a 1-fish benefit to the escapement for each fish forfeited from the harvest, and often such contributions compose a substantial portion of the total escapement objective. Implications for Norton Sound chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta escapements are explored for the South Peninsula June mixed stock fishery compared to more terminal fishing in Norton Sound.},

abstract = {In 1993, six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) had collapsed to the point where a moratorium was declared on fishing. It has been argued that the collapses were caused by poor recruitment of cod to the fishery. Yet we are unable to detect a difference between the recruitment of year classes that should have contributed most to the spawning stock at the time of the collapse and recruitment levels in earlier years. A power analysis shows that we would have almost certainly detected an overall reduction of recruitment of 20{\%}. There are considerable differences in the abundance trends as determined by research surveys and reconstructed from the commercial catch at age data (called ?virtual population analysis? [VPA]) for each stock. VPA-based abundances consistently depict lower recruitment levels than do survey-based estimates in recent years. More important is the observation that from the early 1980s the VPA-based trend shows a decline where none is apparent in the survey-based trend. One explanation of these differences would be an increase in discarding of young fish as fishing mortality increased. We test the hypothesis that the mortality for young cod is unrelated to the fully recruited fishing mortality. This hypothesis is rejected; in each of the six stocks, high juvenile mortality was associated with high adult mortality. This is consistent with the discarding hypothesis. We suggest that age-specific abundance trends estimated from research surveys and VPA should be compared for all stocks where such data exist, and that high priority should be given to the measurement of discarding levels and the extent to which catch misreporting is related to changes in fishing mortality.},

With respect to the technical approaches, meta-analysis indicates that overall reductions in by- catch of between 25{\%} and 64{\%} could be achieved if global fishing fleets could match somewhere between the minimum and median performance of gear modifications used in experimental studies. If such benefits are to be delivered, however, engaging fishers more comprehensively in solving the problems will be essential. Further developing legislative and institutional arrangements will also assist.

In a study of all major United States federal catch share fisheries and associated shared stock fisheries in British Columbia, catch shares result in environmental improvements, economic improvements, and a mixture of changes in social performance, relative to the race for fish under traditional management. Environmentally, compliance with total allowable catch increases and discards decrease. Economically, vessel yields rise, total revenues grow, and long-term stock increases are encouraged. Socially, safety increases, some port areas modestly consolidate, needed processing capacity often reduces, and labor markets shift from part time jobs to full time jobs with similar total employment.

@phdthesis{Branch2004,
abstract = {nder individual transferable quotas (ITQs), participants receive a share of the total allowable catch (TAC), can choose when to fish, and can sell or lease their share. ITQs generally increase fishing flexibility, improve profitability, reduce overcapitalization, and may improve sustainability of the resource through increased stewardship incentives. However, ITQs may increase high-grading and discarding, and create social problems because quota owners have increased control compared to other stakeholders. The U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery is managed under two-monthly landing limits (not ITQs) for each species and has generally high discard levels. The British Columbia groundfish trawl fishery (B.C. fishery) is an ITQ fishery with full observer coverage, where marketable discard mortality is deducted from quotas. Under this system, total discards declined for most species, and marketable discards declined from 0.20{\%} to 0.10{\%}, after an adjustment period. The B.C. system would likely reduce discards in the West Coast fishery, although severe catch restrictions on overfished West Coast species may limit these reductions. To predict fishing changes under fishery regulations, a method was developed for defining “fishing opportunities” for each vessel—groups of trawls over the same portion of a fishing ground. This method uses simple clustering method on Euclidean distances between trawls, offers a more realistic way of defining fishing opportunities than grid cells, and is able to correctly classify simulated trawls into fishing opportunities. The top vessels in the B.C. fishery frequented a wide variety of fishing opportunities (mean 38, range 20–69), in which trawls generally caught similar species. The B.C. fishery is a multispecies fishery with TACs imposed on 22 species. Despite these constraints, skippers were able to adjust the species mixture in their catches to match changes in TACs. Skippers reduced catches of rougheye, shortraker, and yelloweye rockfish by more than 50{\%} when TACs for those species were reduced. However, there was only weak evidence that skippers changed their fishing patterns based on the species mixture of all of the most important species. Instead, a variety of other factors were likely important in determining which fishing opportunities are preferred and avoided in the B.C. fishery.},

abstract = {Fisheries discards are often seen as a waste of resources and an impediment to the management of fish stocks. However, many traditional fisheries management measures have effectively encouraged discarding. This controversial dichotomy has recently prompted the European Commission to review its approach to managing discards, particularly in the North Sea, where discard rates are among the highest in the world. The European Commission jointly manages North Sea fisheries with Norway; however, in Norwegian waters, discarding is banned. To assess the effectiveness of this Norwegian policy, this study examined its effect on biologically isolated stocks of cod, haddock, saithe, and herring in the Northeast Arctic. Trends in stock status and economic performance showed that the Norwegian approach in the Northeast Arctic has been more successful than the joint approach in the North Sea. After considering the economics and current status of stocks, it is concluded that a discard ban throughout the North Sea for the above species could also offer substantial benefits. Implementation of this policy would be complicated by the more mixed nature (both politically and biologically) of North Sea fisheries, but the use of real-time area closures, gear modifications, and electronic monitoring systems could help ensure compliance and effectiveness.},

abstract = {The performance of the EU long-term management plan for cod stocks, in force since 2009, is analysed focusing on the human and institutional factors. The plan operates through landings quotas (TACs) and effort restrictions following a Harvest Control Rule, and deploys a novel instrument allowing Member States to 'buy back' or increase fishing effort for fleet segments engaged in cod-avoidance measures. The stipulated fishing mortality reductions have not been achieved. On the positive side, the 'buy-back' instrument has led to increased uptake of selective gear and implementation of permanent and real-time temporary closures. On the negative side, ignoring the dimension of fishers as reactive agents in the design, the impact assessment, and the annual implementation of the measures has contributed to the failure to adequately implement the plan and achieve its objectives. The main problem is that the landings quotas taken in a mixed fishery did not limit catches because fishers were incentivised to continue fishing and discard overquota catch while quota for other species was available. The effort limitations intended to reduce this effect were insufficient to adequately limit fishing mortality in targeted fisheries, although fishers experienced them as prohibiting the full uptake of other quotas. Recommendations for future plans include (i) management through catch rather than landings quotas, (ii) the internalisation of the costs of exceeding quotas, (iii) use of more selective gear types, (iv) the development of appropriate metrics as a basis for regulatory measures and for evaluations, (v) participatory governance, (vi) fishery-based management, (vii) flexibility in fishing strategy at vessel level. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fisheries management is characterized by multiple and conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders with divergent interests and high levels of uncertainty about the dynamics of the resources being managed. This conjunction of issues can result in high levels of contention and poor outcomes in the management process. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can assist in the resolution of these issues. MSE involves assessing the consequences of a range of management options and laying bare the trade-offs in performance across a range of management objectives. Key steps in the approach involve turning broad objectives into specific and quantifiable performance indicators, identifying and incorporating key uncertainties in the evaluation, and communicating the results effectively to client groups and decision-makers. At a technical level, the framework facilitates dealing with multiple objectives and uncertainties in prediction. At the implementation level, it fails if it cannot accommodate effective stakeholder participation and acceptance. MSE shares many features with approaches such as adaptive management and development of management procedures. The principles for implementing the MSE approach are reviewed and practical aspects of its implementation under the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) partnership model to fisheries management are discussed. The model stresses stakeholder involvement in all key areas of fisheries management, from stock assessment and setting research priorities, to enforcement and decision-making. Stakeholder involvement, including industry, science, and conservation, extends from membership of the AFMA Board, through Management Advisory Committees to Fisheries Assessment Groups. The benefits and limitations of the AFMA partnership approach are reviewed, both for MSE, and, in a wider sense, in the development of an effective fisheries management system},

The Danish Government has proposed a catch quota management system (CQMS) in which fishers are obliged to report their total catches, including discards and landings, and both are counted against the formal total allowable catch (TAC). The success of a CQMS requires appropriate documentation to verify the total catch, the validity of scientific advice, and the implementation of the TACs through national catch quotas. A remote electronic monitoring (EM) system, providing full documentation of fishing operations and catches, was tested on six Danish fishing vessels operating under a CQMS for cod (Gadus morhua). The results showed that the EM system could provide the documentation required to support the CQMS and that it was an incentive for the participating fishers to avoid discarding cod. Changing from landings to total catch quotas would not affect the scientific-advisory processes of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), but it could have notable consequences for the allocation of TACs between countries.},

abstract = {Bycatch is a critical source of mortality for marine species, including endangered species, heavily fished commercial and recreational target species, and many species of so-called “trash fish” whose importance in marine food webs is now being recognized. Whether management objectives include conservation or fisheries yields, adequate measurement of at-sea mortality is a necessary component of any management framework, and observers at sea are the most reliable source of information. The amount of observer effort, when not financially constrained, is usually set to achieve a desirable level of precision, assuming that the observers sample the fleet randomly. The assumption of random sampling is often unjustified, as the sampling process is both conceptually and operationally very complex. The issue of bias in bycatch estimates is often not addressed, despite the fact that many observer programs allocate sampling effort opportunistically to vessels that volunteer to carry observers. The bias introduced by non- random sampling, and by the changes in fishermen's behavior in the presence of observers, must be addressed. Comparing the catches of observed and unobserved vessel-trips should be an ongoing component of any observer program. If the observer samples are an unbiased sample of the fishery, our literature review and simulation studies suggest that coverage levels of at least 20 percent for common species, and 50 percent for rare species, would give reasonably good estimates of total bycatch. The required level of coverage, however, could be much higher or much lower for a particular fishery, depending on the size of the fishery, distribution of catch and bycatch, and spatial stratification of the fishery. 2},

The analytical framework developed by Raakj'r Nielsen (1998) and Raakj'r Nielsen and Vedsmand (1999) has been applied. The research focuses on three Danish fisheries: the cod fishery in the Baltic Sea, the demersal and Nephrops fishery in Kattegat and the protein fishery in the North Sea. The research is based on interviews with 56 fishers and a mail based questionnaire survey covering all vessels (skippers) in the three selected fisheries. Furthermore, interviews have been conducted with enforcement agents and officials of the Directorate of Fisheries. The following factors are concluded to have a major impact on compliance in fisheries: 1) the economic gains to be obtained from non-compliance; 2) the risk of being detected and the severity of the sanction; 3) the compatibility between regulations and the practice and patterns of fishing; 4) perception that regulations conserve fish stocks; 5) the actual and expected behaviour of other fishers and the moral of the individual, 6) finally there is indication, that management procedures, including co-management and enforcement procedures, has an impact on the incentives to comply with the regulations},

abstract = {This paper examines the economics of catch discarding in fisheries. To study this issue a simple dynamic fisheries model is constructed. On the basis of this model it is demonstrated that in a differentiated fishery discarding of catch may be socially optimal. The paper goes on to show that individual firms in a free access, competitive fishery employ the socially optimal discarding rule. In contrast, the individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries management regime tends to generate an excessive incentive for discarding catch. The problem, however, does not appear to derive from the ITQ system as such. Rather, it seems to depend on the imperfect application of the system to real fisheries. The concept of a discarding function is defined and it is shown that at least within the framework of the model employed the discarding function for an ITQ fishery dominates the one for free access, competitive fisheries. Numerical examples are provided. Finally, possible remedies of the discarding problem are briefly discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Total allowable catch (TAC) management has in many fisheries, especially mixed fisheries, failed to meet conservation objectives. For instance, for the Faroe Plateau mixed demersal fisheries, the TAC system failed to achieve the objective of an average annual fishing mortality of 0.45 for the three gadoid stocks cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and saithe (Pollachius virens). Therefore, in 1996, an effort-regulation system with individual transferable effort quotas was introduced to manage the fisheries. Experience has shown that effort management without additional stock-specific measures may not be appropriate for such fisheries. A management strategy evaluation model was developed to compare an effort-management system based on the Faroese example with a TAC system as currently applied in EU fisheries. Results show that when stocks are considered in isolation, a total allowable effort system does not necessarily perform better than a TAC one. It depends on stock status and dynamics, the level of uncertainty, and the reactivity of the system to changes in scientific advice. When the stocks are considered together in mixed fisheries, effort management seems, however, to be appropriate, and interannual flexibility of the system appears to be the best compromise between short- and long-term objectives, as well as between biological sustainability and economic return.},

This system represents a unique and innovative fisheries management case study. This work aims at evaluating its efficiency by comparing it with a TAC management system as it exists in Europe. A Management Strategy Evaluation model (MSE) was built using FLR framework. A MSE is based on an Operating Model (OM) which simulates the stock and a Management Procedure (MP) using Harvest Control Rules (HCR). Different management scenarios were tested (effort or TAC, with or without bound) under different conditions (initial biomass above or below Bpa) with stochastic simulations compare uncertainty in those two systems. In results, an effort system seems to be more biologically sustainable than a TAC one, while producing less variability. However, the underlying assumption of a constant catchability (link between effort and fishing mortality) appears to not be verified in the Faroese},

A list of bugs and improvements was assembled. Conditioning a bioeconomic operating model for the North Sea showed the difficulties of merging economic and biological information. Inconsistencies on the effort definition seem to create additional problems when relating both sources of information. This subject must be further explored.

When individual transferable quotas (ITQs) were additionally introduced, total discard fractions declined for most species, and marketable discard fractions declined from 0.20{\%} to 0.10{\%}, after an adjustment period. In contrast, the US West Coast groundfish fishery, which is regulated by 2-monthly landing limits, has higher discard fractions (31-43{\%} vs. 14-19{\%} for BC). The BC experience suggests that full observer coverage, ITQs, and mortality accounting would reduce West Coast discarding fractions, but severe catch restrictions on overfished West Coast species may limit such reductions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Discarded fish in European waters: general patterns and contrasts. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fst030. To reduce the practice of discarding commercially fished organisms, several measures such as a discard ban and extra allowances on top of landings quotas (“catch quota”) have been proposed by the European Commission. However, for their development and successful implementation, an understanding of discard patterns on a European scale is needed. In this study, we present an inter-national synthesis of discard data collected on board commercial, towed-gear equipped vessels operating under six different national flags spanning from the Baltic to the Mediterranean Seas mainly between 2003 and 2008. We considered discarded species of commercial value such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), European hake (Merluccius merluccius), and European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Comparisons of discard per unit effort rates expressed as numbers per hour of fishing revealed that in the Mediterranean Sea minimum size-regulated species such as hake are generally discarded in much lower numbers than elsewhere. For most species examined, variability in discard rates across regions was greater than across fisheries, suggesting that a region-by-region approach to discard reduction would be more relevant. The high uncertainty in discard rate estimates suggests that current sampling regimes should be either expanded or complemented by other data sources, if they are to be used for setting catch quotas.},

abstract = {North Sea cod Gadus morhua stock is outside safe biological limits, and total allowable catch (TAC) management has proved ineffective to rebuild the stock. The European Commission is considering the imposition of a discard ban to preserve vulnerable and economically important fish stocks. We explored the potential effects of a discard ban in mixed fisheries management using the French mixed fisheries in the Eastern English Channel as a model system. We examined in particular the performance of 2 different management scenarios: (1) individual quota management with a tolerance for discarding and (2) individual quota management in combination with a discard ban, using a dynamic state variable model. The model evaluates a time series of decisions taken by fishers to maximize profits within management constraints. Compliance to management was tested by applying an in-height varying fine for exceeding the quota. We then evaluated the consequences of individual cod quota in both scenarios with respect to over-quota discarding, spatial and temporal effort allocation and switching between metiers. Individual quota management without a discard ban hardly influenced fishers' behaviour as they could fully utilise cod quota and continue fishing other species while discarding cod. In contrast, a discard ban forced fishers to reallocate effort to areas and weeks in which cod catch is low, at the expense of lower revenue. In general, a restrictive policy for individual quota for cod needs to be combined with a discard ban and a high fine ({\textgreater}20 times the sale price) to reduce over-quota discarding.},

abstract = {Traditionally, fisheries management advice has been based on stock assessments that considered merely the “best” set of assumptions while uncertainty arising only from observation and process error was quantified, if considered at all. Unfortunately, uncertainty attributable to lack of understanding of the true underlying system and to ineffective implementation may dominate the sources of error that must be accounted for if management is to be successful. The management procedure approach is advocated as the appropriate way to develop management advice for renewable resources. This approach, pioneered by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee, takes politically agreed management objectives and incorporates all scientific aspects of management including data collection and analysis, development of robust harvest control laws or effort regulations, and monitoring. A primary feature is that uncertainty (including that arising from sources conventionally ignored) is taken into account explicitly through population simulations for a variety of scenarios. The nature of the management procedures developed for commercial and aboriginal subsistence whaling and the processes by which they have been developed is highlighted. We also identify lessons that have been learned from two decades of IWC experience and suggest how these can be applied to other fishery situations.},

The approach differs from the conventional model approaches based on population dynamics, but allows conclusions to be drawn based on recent experience in management. The conclusion is that the most important factor enhancing long-termstability is a low rate of fishing mortality, but that following scientific advice on a year-to-year basis would decrease stability. Unless TACs varied considerably, they did not appear to affect variations in landings significantl},

abstract = {Pilchard (sardine) and anchovy are the main targets of South Africa's pelagic fishery. This fishery is the country's second most valuable in monetary terms, and produces the highest annual yield in terms of landed mass (in recent years, a combined catch of the order of 400 000 t). It is the most dynamic of South Africa's main commercial fisheries, because the species targeted are relatively short-lived, often occur in mixed shoals, and experience large fluctuations in abundance. Mixed shoaling causes operational problems for the fishery, because of the inevitability of juvenile pilchard bycatch (of more value as adults for canning) in the anchovy-directed fishery. This operational interaction implies a trade-off between allowable catches for the two species, and hence necessitates that they are managed together. The development of a joint "management procedure" (sensu IWC) for the two species is described. This provides a framework for quantifying this trade-off, subject to the constraint that acceptable levels of risk of "collapse" are not exceeded for either resource. Important new features incorporated in a revision of the procedure implemented in 2002, which have made appreciably enhanced catches from the resources possible, are described.

abstract = {The fishery for the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) on the coast of Germany (Lower Saxony) produces a rich food source for ship-following seabirds. Large quantities of discarded fish and invertebrates attract flocks of gulls and terns. Between March 1993 and August 1994 the number and species composition of birds following two shrimp trawlers were determined. The main scavengers were herring gull (Larus argentatus) and black-headed gull (L. ridibundus). Common gull (L. canus), lesser black-backed gull (L. fuscus), great black-backed gull (L. marinus), and common/arctic tern (Sterna hirundo/paradisaea) were less numerous. The distribution of scavenging seabirds behind the shrimp trawlers showed a marked species-specific seasonal and spatial pattern. The scavenging behaviour of seabirds feeding on discards was studied by means of experimental discarding. Of 10 356 items offered, 8253 were picked up by the birds, and in 8072 of these the consuming bird was identified. Herring gulls were most successful. Although this species represents only 45{\%} of all birds counted, they took 82{\%} of the total number of items consumed. In total, ship-following seabirds consumed 41{\%} of the offered mass of flatfish, 79{\%} of the roundfish, and 23{\%} of four invertebrate species. In feeding experiments birds consumed 10{\%} of undersized shrimps. Applying these consumption rates and bioenergetic data to the total quantity of discarded biota, approximately 90 000 seabirds may be supported by this source throughout the entire fishing season (April–November 1993). Potentially, the discards of the shrimp trawler fleet of Lower Saxony were sufficient to meet the energy demand of 60 000 birds for the whole year. The results suggest that discards may have strong effects on the bird populations and the ecosystem of the Wadden Sea},

But predicting the response of seabird communities to changes in discard rates is problematic and requires historical data to elucidate the confounding effects of other, more ‘natural' ecological processes. In the North Sea, declining stocks, changes in technical measures, changes in population structure9 and the establishment of a recovery programme for cod (Gadus morhua10) will alter the amount of fish discarded. This region also supports internationally important populations of seabirds11, some of which feed extensively, but facultatively, on discards, in particular on undersized haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus)1–3. Here we use long-term data sets from the northern North Sea to show that there is a direct link between discard availability and discard use by a generalist predator and scavenger—the great skua (Stercorarius skua). Reduced rates of discarding, particularly when coupled with reduced availability of small shoaling pelagic fish such as sandeel (Ammodytes marinus), result in an increase in predation by great skuas on other birds. This switching of prey by a facultative scavenger presents a potentially serious threat to some seabird communities.},

For each species there can be different catchability coefficients, handling times, and prices. The duration of each fishing trip is assumed fixed. The model is used to determine the profit-maximizing fishing tactics (the fishing locations and time spent at each location) and to explore the conditions that generate deliberate bycatch and discarding when one of the species cannot be sold because it is unmarketable or because of trip limits.},

This paper examines how profit maximizing fishers respond to different types of IQ programs in fisheries where many types of fish are harvested simultaneously. This analysis shows that the most common types of individual quota programs can induce discarding, and that individual quota programs that regulate the value of harvests never induce discarding. Since discarded fish have a high mortality rate, “value-based” individual quota programs are superior to their more conventional counterparts in that they waste fewer fish. The disadvantages of value-based quotas are also examined. Results are driven by the fact that the harvest technology examined here does not satisfy a “free-disposal” assumption. Since this free-disposal assumption is ubiquitous in production theory, and not obviously true, the framework developed herein may be useful for analyzing a broad class of problems involving joint production.},

It is shown that in a nonregulated fishery, either multispecies or single species/multisize, where the only constraints are the hold capacity and the length of the season, the fisherman may have rational incentives to discard/highgrade, if the marginal trip profit of an extra fishing day is greater than the average trip profit. Regulation by TAC does not change the incentives to discard. However, under INTQs and ITOs, the incentives to discard increase. The incentives to discard decrease under ITQs compared to INTQs, if the unit quota price is smaller than the shadow price of the quota. The model is applied to the Greenland shrimp fishery, where it demonstrates the reported discard behavior in the fishery. Finally, different regulations of discard are applied and discussed in the model. The analysis suggests that regulation of fishing days could be a promising alternative to usual suggested measures like tax/subsidies and landings obligations},

However, the sampling design and methods used in these studies generally rely on implicit assumptions. In this perspective, we examine the available evidence in favour of or refuting these assumptions. We find that (i) the assumptions most commonly used for estimating discards, namely that discards are proportional to catch or to effort, are generally not supported by the available evidence, (ii) both environmental conditions and fishing methods influence the amounts and composition of discards, but because of the huge variability, sampling stratification according to these factors might not result in any improvement of the precision of discard estimates, and (iii) many intricate factors can play a role in determining discards in a particular fishery. We conclude that assumptions should be more carefully checked prior to being taken for granted in discard studies and that more studies designed to improve knowledge of the discarding processes are needed.},

abstract = {Discarding of target species can be substantial in some fisheries. For fisheries managed using Total Allowable Catches, such as Australia's Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), discarding of target species can occur for reasons related to the size of the fish caught, markets, and the amount of quota held by individual quota holders. This paper illustrates how the assessments for two of the species in the SESSF, blue grenadier, Macruronus novaezelandiae, and the western stock of blue warehou, Seriolella brama, are conducted to take account of discards. Discards of blue grenadier are predominantly small fish so the assessment distinguishes between retained and discarded fish, and includes likelihood components related to the weight of the discards and the age-structure of the discards. In contrast, discards of blue warehou are due primarily to quota-related issues, so the assessment adds the discards to the catches and the catch-rate indices, and fits to total catches and catch-rates. Model outputs suggest that strong year-classes can be detected before they enter the fishery by including data on discards in assessments while ignoring such data when conducting assessments can lead to biased assessment outcomes. Several caveats related to the use of data on discards in stock assessments are outlined. Crown Copyright ?? 2006.},

Complementary to the use of research vessel data, platforms of opportunity can be a powerful strategy to monitor species distributions at high temporal and spatial resolution.In this study we use data from commercial fishing vessels, collecting - under the European Union data collection framework - biological data on all species that are caught and subsequently discarded. Using such discard data in combination with a systematic trawl survey, we model the spatial and temporal distribution of juvenile plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the central North Sea. There is a clear age-dependent difference between the commercial fishing vessel data and the research vessel data, with age 1 being the dominating age in the survey catches, while age 2 is the dominating age in the discards. The results show how immature plaice, slowly migrate from the nursery areas, westwards into the deeper regions of the North Sea. Also, the results show that during the study period, juvenile plaice gradually moved to deeper waters at an earlier age. Finally we discuss how the framework can be applied to similar opportunistic data to monitor seasonal and inter-annual migration of marine organisms, and to quantify how they may be influenced by biotic and abiotic gradients, such as temperature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Observer-based estimates of quantities, size and age distributions of by-catches and discarded catches may be biased by nonrepresentative selection of sampling units (fisher-days or trips) or by changes in fishing practices onboard trawlers when observers are present. In this study, we examined the accuracy of estimates of catch derived from an observer survey of retained and discarded catches in a multispecies fish trawl fishery off the coast of NSW, Australia. Observer-based estimates of magnitudes and size-distributions of retained catches were compared with independent, unbiased estimates that were available for a subset of species (species managed by catch quotas) caught in the fishery. Conclusions about bias in estimates of other components of catch (especially discards) are based on the premise that bias is unlikely to affect these estimates without also affecting estimates of retained catches of quota species. We conclude that estimates of catch, based on the 3-year period 1993-1995, were unaffected by significant bias. Observer-based estimates of magnitudes of retained catches did not differ significantly from reported landings for 6 out of 7 species and the combined catch of quota species (CQS) for the Ulladulla fleet, 11 out of 11 species and CQS for the Eden fleet and 10 out of 11 Species and CQS for the 2 fleets combined. There was, however, some evidence of bias in estimates of catch for each fleet in 1 of the 3 years. Observer-based size-distributions were not significantly biased. We conclude that our approach to validating observer-based estimates of catch would also be of use in observer surveys of other fisheries.},

abstract = {The decision by fishermen to discard or retain fish of low value to make room for more valuable fish in the hold of a boat (high-grading) is similar to diet choice problems faced by natural foragers. In our study, we apply the rationale of diet choice theory to high-grading behavior in the Oregon trawl fishery by treating fishermen as foragers who must decide how much of each net's haul to "ingest" before searching for more prey. We derive a state-dependent, temporal model of discarding behavior within a fishing trip. This optimization considers the availability of differently valued fish, trip quotas set by the regulatory agency, and the risk of premature trip termination due to loss of gear or injury. The results' indicate that those parameters affect discarding behavior through their effect on the probability of exceeding the allowable catch, which we consider analogous to gut capacity. High-grading (partial prey consumption) occurred throughout many simulated trips. The predictions were consistent with the trends in discarding observed in the Oregon trawl fleet. Behavioral models s{\~{}}ch as ours can be useful to fishery managers by providing a means to explore the potential responses of fishermen to new regulations before they are implemented},

Develop- ment of accurate measures of discard mortality requires fundamental knowledge, based on principles of bycatch stressor action, of why discarded fish die. To date, discard mortality studies in the field have focused on capture stressors. Recent laboratory discard experiments have demonstrated the significant role of environmental factors, size- and species-related sensitivity to stressors, and interactions of stressors, which increase mortality. In addition, delayed mortality was an important consideration in experimental design. The discard mortality problem is best addressed through a combination of laboratory investigation of classes of bycatch stressors to develop knowledge of key principles of bycatch stressor action and field experiments under realistic fishing conditions to verify our understanding and make predictions of discard mortality. This article makes the case for a broader ecological perspective on discard mortality that includes a suite of environmental and biological factors that may interact with capture stressors to increase stress and mortality.},

abstract = {The existing literature (i) examines bycatch and discard behavior in a static framework and (ii) treats bycatch as a deterministic process uniform across vessels. Using a dynamic representative agent model in a two-stock resource, this paper explores strategic interactions between a social planner and two groups of harvesters, one of which imposes a stochastic "technological externality" (bycatch) on the other. In addition to limitations on entry and the number of trips taken in each industry, three bycatch control instruments are compared to the unconstrained case: taxes, trip limits, and value-based quotas. Implementation and enforcement costs aside, taxes dominate both types of quota, and value limits outperform trip limits by eliminating one type of discarding. In simulations, relative performance depends upon variance in the bycatch process, differences in the ex vessel prices of stocks, relative efficiency of the harvester types, and fixed costs on the trip and industry margins. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Cotter2002,
abstract = {This survey was intended to permit efficient, unbiased estimation of discarding and retention of cod, haddock and whiting by English fishing vessels over 12 m registered length in the North Sea in four sampling periods during 1997 and 1998 using only two sea-going observers. The 'probability proportional to size' (PPS) sampling method was used to avoid problems previously experienced with stratification of the survey by gear. Vessels were selected with replacement and with probability proportional to predicted catching power and effort, and inversely proportional to average trip length, thereby giving priority to those expected to catch the most fish whilst maximising information for each observer-day at sea. A trip on each selected vessel was then observed in the order of drawing so far as practically possible, giving a reasonably random selection from those made by each vessel in the sampling period. PPS estimators were formulated as if vessels were the sampling units. The values measured on each were the total numbers of fish of each species discarded and retained by the vessel over the sampling period as estimated by raising numbers observed on a trip to numbers for the period using a factor based on hours fishing. The effects of measurement errors on the PPS estimators are assessed. Results for trips which could not be observed, e.g. for safety reasons, were modelled to make use of known effort by the vessel. Discarded proportions of numbers caught by the fleet were estimated to be 20-48{\%} for cod, 30-41{\%} for haddock, and 51-65{\%} for whiting. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for numbers discarded varied between 20 and 50{\%} based on 14-25 fishing trips observed in each sampling period. Random sampling improved knowledge about the fleet and confidence in catch estimates. Reducing the number of long trips observed improved the information gained per day at sea but otherwise the PPS method proved not to be as statistically efficient as had been hoped mainly because catch and effort by the NE coast fleet were not accurately foretold by historical data. However, this was not a problem peculiar to PPS and ease of implementation commended PPS over competing designs given a small number of observers, variable trip durations, difficulties with stratification, and ideally, reliable information about the fleet in a forthcoming sampling period. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents optimum sampling levels in discard sampling programs considering cost and precision objectives simultaneously and explores their dependence on both variables. The analysis is based on the Irish discard program: an onboard-observer voluntary sampling scheme aimed at estimating discard rates in trawl fisheries. Multistage analysis was performed to establish the precision levels achieved in the past, and a cost function was determined to estimate the financial cost of the program. Gear, fishing ground, targeted species, and International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) divisions were the main factors affecting discarding, together with random effects of the three nested groups considered: haul, trip, and vessel. Reductions in the present budget will imply only marginal decreases in precision, although changes in cost variables can have an impact on sampling levels. On the other hand, increasing the target precision by one-half will imply a considerable increase in sampling and associated cost, which will be difficult if not impossible to achieve. Finally, the analysis by fleet components suggests a marked increase in sampling levels, which emphasizes the importance of clearly stated discard sampling objectives.},

abstract = {PGRFS was established by the ICES WKSMRF (Workshop on Marine Recreational Fishing) to discuss and develop common method for recreational fishing survey. EU members States are required to establish such programmes for several key species (cod, European seabass, eels, salmon and bluefin tuna according to ICES area) in or-der to meet the requirements of the EU Data Collection Framework (EC Regulations 199/2008 and EC Decision 2008/949/EC). The first part of the survey was devoted to presentations: • Harold Levrel reminded the group of the Terms of References for this workshop. • Dave Van Voorhees presented the conclusions and recommendations of last year's workshop (WKSMRF 2009). The aim was to identify survey method to estimate the annual catch (landings and discards), CPUE and age and size structure. The preferable approach retained was comple-mented survey design with both off-site survey and on-site survey. • Harry Strehlow related Recommendation from RCM Baltic 2010 to PGRFS. • Jeremy Lyle reported on a telephone-diary approach that has been used in Australia to obtain both effort and catch estimates. This off-site approach is very cost-effective and provides good coverage of catch information for night-time and private access fishing trips that are typically difficult to as-sess in on-site surveys. The success of this approach relies heavily on the implementation of a comprehensive process for managing respondents that involves highly trained interviewers and sustains both high response rates and low rates of respondent recall error. He also presented a method to estimate recall bias comparing two types of surveys. • Dave Van Voorhees described survey lessons learned in the US as they al-ready have a long experience. • Each country presented its own context, method, results and improve-ments. The recreational fishing can be evaluated at different level. First the population of fisher needs to be identified. Screening surveys and list frame (i.e.: license register) survey appears to be the most successful method. Screening and list frame survey are most of the time done by telephone or by mail. It was adopted that this kind of off-site surveys gives estimation of the recreational fishers' population. Then to evaluate the capture it has been proved that off-site surveys present important recall biases for capture declaration. So to appraise the mean catch rate, the effective method that was pointed out is diaries and logbooks of panel of recreational fishers. Species, details about weight and size are recorded in diaries and give better accuracy about catch. However they need to be validated with on-site sampling such as access point sur-vey, roving, survey and visual survey. The definition of the primary survey unit (PSU) and secondary survey unit (SSU) is a very important part of the sampling, mainly to combine different kind of survey. Furthermore stratification and estimation domain can be different. To facilitate an evaluation of appropriate recreational fishery survey schemes in Europe, PGRFS participants discussed and established schemes of survey methods for recreational fisheries. The national reports are included in the overall workshop report. Break-out groups were formed at PGRFS to develop recommendations for common methodological approaches for surveying marine recreational fishing that could be developed through international collaboration in the Baltic; the North Sea, the North Atlantic (ICES areas IV –VII) and from Biscay to the Mediterranean. The main conclusions from these groups, and from subsequent discussions, are summa-rised below: - The importance of dual-frame approach was underlined. Also combining dif-ferent survey methods. - List frame such as recreational fishermen registry helps a lot for survey de-sign. Maybe the EU can incite member countries to have a registration (free but obligatory). The word of “license” should not be used to avoid conflict and refusal from the population. - At a European scale, common approaches can be implemented to survey na-tional population of recreational fisher following the method recommenda-tions of the PGRFS. But for local scale, contexts can be so different that it influences a lot the method and standardization could be too hard to design. - The collaboration between ICES countries is very important and a PGRFS meeting is necessary next year. Balearic Island proposed to host it in June 2011. - Recreational fishing is a non negligible part of resources collection and hu-man impact on environment. In the US the budget to study recreational fish-ing is now bigger than that for commercial fishing. EU and ICES have to provide support and funding for recreational fishing survey and include it in main species stock assessment. Maybe the Planning group should become a working group.},

We estimated the weight of the discard, using an estimate of 0.54 kg per fish (Collette and Klein- MacPhee, 2002). This estimate was calculated by taking a weighted average of the weights-at-age of bluefish that are under the Gulf of Mexico minimum size limit. This estimate may be high, as the South Atlantic does not have a minimum size limit.

abstract = {Factors influencing the species composition and magnitude of landings and discards were evaluated based on data from at-sea observations of 4 533 otter trawl tows. Data were collected from the USA mixed species otter trawl fisheries of the Georges Bank-Southern New England region, sampled during 1989–92. General linear models for main effects have related discard rates, total catch, and indices of species richness, diversity and evenness to temporal, spatial and operational variables associated with the fishing process (year, month, statistical reporting area, primary species sought, cod-end mesh size, vessel size, tow duration, total catch, total discards and depth). Discarding rates (proportion of the catch discarded) varied significantly both for individual species and for aggregated species by year, area, month, and target species. The effects of cod-end mesh size were variable, and confounded with year-class strength, particularly in the case of yellowtail flounder. Fisheries regulated by minimum fish and mesh sizes (e.g. for flounders and large gadoids) generally exhibited higher average discard rates and more variation than fisheries directed to species without such restrictions (e.g. for small pelagics, skates and others). The species composition and diversity of catches were significant functions of area, year, target species and month, as well as mesh size and tow duration. Year effects were more important for explaining variation in discard rates than total (multispecies) catches. This result is probably because large, partially-recruited year-classes differentially attract effort from other species targets, but most of the fleet landings are composed of mixed catches of species at moderate abundance levels. Multivariate approaches to analysis of sea sampling data offer important insights into the potential effectiveness of technological and area/time management measures for reducing fishery discards.},

Generalised additive models were used to assess how discards of the 3 main target species, Norway lobster, cod and plaice, and their subcomponents (under and over minimum landings size) are influenced by important factors and their potential relevance to management. Our results show that discards are influenced by a range of different factors that are different for each species and portion of discards. We argue that knowledge about the factors influential to discarding and their use in relation to potential mitigation measures are essential for future fisheries management strategies.},

POs or other fishermen's organizations can set up real-time swapping tools, within and between organizations. The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) would support POs and fishermen to this end. They would also receive support from the EMFF to implement the discard ban and handle the landed catches, including storage aid, support for building extra storage facilities on shore and funding marketing campaigns to promote the consumption of lesser known fish by consumers. What happens in case of unintentional catches despite improved selectivity? Fish with known high survival rates should be identified and released alive back into the sea. All other fish caught would be landed and counted against the quotas. These catches would be handled as follows: Undersized fish. Minimum conservation reference sizes will be set on biological grounds. These will be the yardstick for developing the best gears to minimize catches of juveniles. The measures can then be adapted at regional level via regionalization to obtain the best results. Fish below this minimum size can only be sold for fish meal or pet food production. Fishermen can thus cover the landing costs, but without generating financial gain. Fish caught in excess of individual quota. Fish caught in excess of individual quotas can be marketed normally. Where vessel owners are about to run out of one or more of their quotas they need to buy or lease quotas from another vessel owner in the same MS. Where this is impossible quota overshoot rules apply as it is the responsibility of the fishermen to ensure that they have all quotas necessary to land their catches.},

The aim of the current analysis was to reveal the historical development of the EAF and put it into perspective of its potential benefits and pitfalls. Current fisheries management approaches of the European Commission and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to implement an EAF are critically analysed. Shortcomings preventing a successful implementation of an EAF could be thereby identified on all levels, reaching from missing basic knowledge to an insufficient amount of data and questionable management concepts. Ideas how to overcome these shortcomings are discussed and some alternatives to currently planned measures to achieve a sustainable exploitation of fish stocks inside an EAF are suggested. It could be demonstrated that the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) concept in its current form is not suitable to reach the various objectives of an EAF. It is discussed how this concept can be changed to meet the various objectives.},

Comprehensive discard reconstruction and abundance estimation using flexible selectivity functions. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 763–771.The additional mortality caused by discarding may hamper the sustainable use of marine resources, especially if it is not accounted for in stock assessment and fisheries management. Generally, long and precise time‐series on age-structured landings exist, but historical discard estimates are often lacking or imprecise. The flatfish fishery in the North Sea is a mixed fishery targeting mainly sole and plaice. Owing to the gear characteristics and a minimum landing size for these species, considerable discarding occurs, especially for juvenile plaice. Discard samples collected by on-board observers are available since 1999 from a limited number of commercial fishing trips. Here, we develop a statistical catch-at-age model with flexible selectivity functions to reconstruct historical discards and estimate stock abundance. We do not rely on simple predefined selectivity ogives, but use spline smoothers to capture the unknown non-linear selectivity and discard patterns, and allow these to vary in time. The model is fitted to the age-structured landings, discards, and survey data, the most appropriate model is selected, and estimates of uncertainty are obtained.},

Individual quotas, fishing effort allocation, and over-quota discarding in mixed fisheries. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 323–333. Many fisheries are managed by total allowable catches (TACs) and a substantial part by individual quotas. Such output management has not been successful in mixed fisheries when fishers continue to fish while discarding marketable fish. We analyse the effects of individual quotas on spatial and temporal effort allocation and over-quota discarding in a multispecies fishery. Using a spatially explicit dynamic-state variable model, the optimal fishing strategy of fishers constrained by annual individual quotas, facing uncertainty in catch rates, is studied. Individual fishers will move away from areas with high catches of the restricted quota species and, depending on the cost of fishing, will stop fishing in certain periods of the year. Individual vessels will discard marketable fish, but only after their individual quota for the species under consideration has been reached. These results are in line with observations on effort allocation and discarding of marketable fish, both over-quota discarding and highgrading, by the Dutch beam-trawl fleet. The models we present can be used to predict the outcomes of management and are therefore a useful tool for fisheries scientists and managers.},

abstract = {Discarding in commercially exploited fisheries has received considerable attention in the last decade, though only more recently in Australia. The Reef Line fishery (RLF) of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia is a large-scale multi-sector, multi-species, highly regulated hook and line fishery with the potential for high levels of discarding. We used a range of data sources to estimate discard rates and discard quantities for the two main target groups of the RLF, the coral trout, Plectropomus spp, and the red throat emperor, Lethrinus miniatus, and investigated possible effects on discarding of recent changes in management of the fishery. Fleet-wide estimates of total annual quantities discarded from 1989 to 2003 were 292-622 t and 33-95 t for coral trout and red throat emperor, respectively. Hypothetical scenarios of high-grading after the introduction of a total allowable commercial catch for coral trout resulted in increases in discard quantities up to 3895 t, while no high-grading still meant 421 t were discarded. Increasing the minimum size limit of red throat emperor from 35 to 38 cm also increased discards to an estimated 103 t. We provide spatially and temporally explicit estimates of discarding for the two most important species in the GBR RLF of Australia to demonstrate the importance of accounting for regional variation in quantification of discarding. Effects of management changes on discarding are also highlighted. This study provides a template for exploring discarding levels for other species in the RLF and elsewhere. Crown Copyright ?? 2007.},

The different auxiliary variables used to raise discard samples to population levels give significantly different results, with effort in hours fished giving the highest discard estimates. Fishing trips was the recommended variable to estimate discards in six out of ten fleets studied.

abstract = {Estimating discards is an important issue for fisheries management so that total mortality caused by fishing is considered. In 2003, a sampling programme addressing Iberian hake discards by the Portuguese fleets was implemented according to the requirements of the European Commission Data Collection Regulation (Reg. EC No 1543/2000). A preliminary analysis of the data collected showed trip and haul duration to be potential sources of bias, because their relationship to discards per unit effort (DPUE) was not linear. This paper develops estimators for discards by weight using fishing effort as auxiliary information, describes a jack-knife procedure to identify influential observations, applies the methodologies to Iberian hake as a case study and compares the results obtained by each estimator. The estimators tested are based on Cochran's estimator of the total (Cochran, 1977). Four estimators are compared, each one consisting of a combination of (i) weighting or not weighting the observations by fishing effort and (ii) post-stratifying or not post-stratifying the trips by duration in days-at-sea. A jack-knife analysis of observations' influence on the final estimate is performed by year and fleet. The results indicate that the estimator that uses both a weighted DPUE and post-stratification by the trip duration performs best and is the most robust to influential observations. The estimates of hake discards increase with time, while a stable but oscillating pattern is observed in the demersal fleet. Total hake discards show a fluctuating trend until 2009 and a large drop in 2010. The minimum discard estimates after removing influential observations was 795. t in 2006 and the maximum was 1956. t in 2009, with coefficients of variation (CV) between 22{\%} and 74{\%}. Estimates using the full data set were higher but had lower CVs. The observed trend in discards agrees with the recruitment estimates by the Portuguese International Bottom Trawl Survey. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) plays an important role in the North Sea benthic ecosystem and is by weight the most important commercial flatfish species in the North Sea demersal fishery. There is a high discarding of plaice in the active demersal fisheries in the North Sea. The change in fisheries management towards a more ecosystem based approach, together with a greater focus on sustainability, has caused a severe need for action. Subsequently, the European Commission is preparing regulations to reduce or even ban discards. The trawl fisheries are commercially the most important Danish fishery targeting plaice. Here we analyse discard data collected onboard Danish vessels in the period from 1998 to 2008. We describe the general patterns in these data by dividing them into three mesh size categories: 80-99. mm, 100-119. mm and ??? 120. mm to reflect implemented technical measures of relevance. We analyse the landed and discarded portions in these mesh size categories and link the discarding to the minimum landing size. We employed a GAM model to assess how discarding of plaice below the minimum landing size is connected to relevant factors that could be of relevance from a management perspective. We identified a statistical significant effect of mesh size category and area. We discuss the results in relation to potential mitigation measures to be implemented in future fisheries management strategies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The catches and by-catches of oceanic prawn trawlers were identified and quantified in a stratified, randomized, observer survey of four of the most important fleets in NSW, Australia. For each port, catches were sampled from all tows done during replicate fishing trips in each season from winter 1990 to autumn 1992. Data were examined using analyses of variance of relative abundances of individual species and groups of species, multi-dimensional scaling of the full by-catch dataset, estimates of retained by-catches and discards by the four ports (incorporating estimates of fishing effort) and length-frequency distributions of common discards. The results revealed a latitudinal gradient in by-catch and discarding with larger quantities occurring northwards. However, significant species-specific variations in abundances were detected at all spatial and temporal scales sampled such that the occurrences and abundances of particular by-catch species depended on the location, season and year examined. In catching an estimated 1 579t of prawns during the two-year survey, the oceanic prawn trawlers from the four ports were estimated to have caught approx. 16435t of by-catch (a by-catch-to-prawn ratio of 10.4:1). Of this by-catch, 2 952t were estimated to have been retained for sale and 13 458t were discarded - including several million individuals of commercially and recreationally important species (e.g. snapper, eastern blue-spot flathead, red-spot whiting). We discuss the results in terms of the spatial and temporal variations in these discards and the relative effectiveness of various ways to reduce them, including fixed and flexible closures to trawling and selective trawl gears and fishing practices.},

abstract = {This paper is about improving the viability of discard-reduction pilot projects. One way to address the problem of wasteful discarding of fish at sea is to initiate pilot projects to trial potential solutions, such as selective gear, area closures, discard bans and data enhancement, which could subsequently be adopted by the fishing industry, either voluntarily or through regulation. However, such pilot projects are often difficult both to set up and to sustain through to completion and implementation. This study reviewed 15??discard-related pilot projects to find out what were the most important determinants of their success or lack of it, and to recommend ways in which the prospects of future pilots could be improved. The review identifies the seven most important factors associated with the viability of the pilot projects - fisheries crises; incentivization; funding; expertise; leadership; and enforcement - and shows how fisheries regulators could take steps to reinforce these factors - by faster responses to crises; more incentives and funding; greater use of fishers' knowledge and leadership; and better enforcement mechanisms.

abstract = {Commercial capture fisheries produce huge quantities of offal, as well as undersized and unwanted catch in the form of discards. Declines in global catches and legislation to ban discarding will significantly reduce discards, but this subsidy supports a large scavenger community. Understanding the potential impact of declining discards for scavengers should feature in an eco-system based approach to fisheries management, but requires greater knowledge of scavenger/fishery interactions. Here we use bird-borne cameras, in tandem with GPS loggers, to provide a unique view of seabird/fishery interactions. 20,643 digital images (one min−1) from ten bird-borne cameras deployed on central place northern gannets Morus bassanus revealed that all birds photographed fishing vessels. These were large ({\textgreater}15 m) boats, with no small-scale vessels. Virtually all vessels were trawlers, and gannets were almost always accompanied by other scavenging birds. All individuals exhibited an Area-Restricted Search (ARS) during foraging, but only 42{\%} of ARS were associated with fishing vessels, indicating much ‘natural' foraging. The proportion of ARS behaviours associated with fishing boats were higher for males (81{\%}) than females (30{\%}), although the reasons for this are currently unclear. Our study illustrates that fisheries form a very important component of the prey-landscape for foraging gannets and that a discard ban, such as that proposed under reforms of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, may have a significant impact on gannet behaviour, particularly males. However, a continued reliance on ‘natural' foraging suggests the ability to switch away from scavenging, but only if there is sufficient food to meet their needs in the absence of a discard subsidy.},

Ghoti publishes succinct commentary and opinion that addresses important areas in fish and fisheries science. Ghoti contributions will be innovative and have a perspective that may lead to fresh and productive insight of concepts, issues and research agendas. All Ghoti contributions will be selected by the editors and peer reviewed.Etymology of Ghoti George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950), polymath, playwright, Nobel prize winner, and the most prolific letter writer in history, was an advocate of English spelling reform. He was reportedly fond of pointing out its absurdities by proving that ‘fish' could be spelt ‘ghoti'. That is: ‘gh' as in ‘rough', ‘o' as in ‘women' and ‘ti' as in palatial.AbstractDuring fishing operations, fish are often caught that were not targeted. When the species in question are of low value, or protected, this ‘by-catch' is often thrown overboard as ‘discards', the retained part of the catch constituting the landings. The amounts of fish discarded are generally highly area- and gear-specific, but can be high; for example, discards in tropical shrimp trawl fisheries may be one order of magnitude higher than the retained catch. The latest analysis undertaken by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations suggests that global discards have declined in recent years, indicating that wastage is being reduced in global fisheries operations. By all accounts, reducing waste is a good thing, and hence good news. Nevertheless, if one considers this decline in discards in conjunction with the reported decline in global fisheries landings over the last decade, it becomes evident that total global fisheries catches (consisting of landings plus discards) might have declined at a substantially steeper rate than previously thought. This could be bad news, if it is indicative of declining total availability of fish. While acknowledging the high uncertainty in both discard and landings data at the global scale through time, the present observation may serve as an urgent reminder that global fisheries may be in more trouble than we thought previously.},

This study assesses the consequences, causes, and potential solutions to the discard problem using the example of North Sea fisheries.
